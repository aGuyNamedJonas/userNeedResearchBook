# Find People

In user research you want to find out what our users do and how and why they do it.
If we know this, we can design our products accordingly.

To be able to do research on the »how« and »why« of user’s work, you need to find some users who would like to answer your questions and would show you what they do.
These users are our (research) participants.
(Your participants may be called your »sample«, in contrast to all those who could be possibly be participants, the »population«.
 So a sample – some users – is a part of the population – all possible users)

## Who are possible participants?

The participants in your research need to be similar to the future users of your final product.
If you plan to create an app for people to create bibliographies it makes sense that the participants are students or researchers.
If you plan to design a skateboard try to find people who skate.
The point is: you need to make up your mind who might give you the information about the how and why of the activities you want to support with your product.

When selecting possible participants, I recommend doing a check based on (assumed) user behavior.
Ask yourself: Are the people that may participate in your research likely to…

- …do the tasks the people do who should use your final product?
- …have similar problems?
- …have similar motivations?

I assume that you don't have the money to employ a recruiting agency to get your participants.
Thus, you will need to find and ask them yourself.
Especially if you are on your own you may need to compromise and do research with participants
that don't match your intended users exactly.
When doing this, keep in mind to  check for similarity of tasks, problems and motivations.
These checks don't ensure that the participants are exactly the ones who may use your final product.
But you can be rather sure that they can tell you something that is of interest for you.

If you design an app for people to create bibliographies and you can only get some bachelor and masters students, but no professors, your results will still reveal a lot about the processes of creating bibliographies.
The student’s motivation is probably writing final term papers and the professors would like to  write journal papers. This  is a possible difference. But as long as you aware of it, you are probably fine. But if you want to design a skateboard and the only participants you can get are all elderly people who enjoy hiking, you are in trouble  (if you find elderly people who enjoy skating, go for it).

## How can I find participants?

Think of methods to make possible participants aware of your research and the possibility to participate.
For example, participants could be found among

- Employees of other departments
- Friends and family
- The people who see your posts on social media
- The people who visit your or your companies homepage
- Participants of meetings/gatherings.

To find the right participants for your research, try to find out where those people are: users of a
particular software can be found on mailing lists, forums and user meetings or events.
Young adults could be found via bulletin boards on on university or college campus.
Retired people may be found in church congregation and retirement homes.

Inform possible participants about the study and what they can expect when they participate.
Regardless of how you inform them – if by speaking directly to them, by using a note on a blackboard
or by writing an email –  you should give them the following information:

- The purpose of the study and the resulting benefits for the participant or the wider community (e.g. a product which is more suitable to their needs)
- The research method (answering questions and observation)
- The time frame (ranging usually from 30min-2h)
- Incentives (if you can afford it)
- Your contact information

> We, a team of students of the Weimar University,  want to improve the free layout program frame
drawer and want the application to match your workflow and needs.
Therefore, we would like to gather some insights in the way you work.
>
> If you would like to support us, someone from our team would visit your workplace and ask you some
questions and look over your shoulder while you work.
This would take approximately 1h.

> All participants get a $10 voucher for the university's cafeteria.
If you would  like to participate (or have further questions) please write a mail to jan.dittrich@example.com


When you reach out to communities for recruiting be sure to comply to the rules of the organizations or social groups involved.
It does not help your research if the community you target gets upset with you for violating their privacy and customs.
If you are unsure, just ask.
These people you ask, lets say a clergyman or a meetup organizer may even be able to set you up with people who can help you.
Once you started your research  you can ask  participants if they know other people who match your ideas of possible participants.
It is likely that they know some other people who work in the same job or have similar hobbies. (In the literature this is also called »Snowball sampling«)


## How many participants do I need?

When estimating how many participants you need,  consider how many resources (time and/or money) you can spend on doing the research.
Each additional participant gives you additional data and a broader view on your possible users.
However, each research session needs time do and adds to the amount of data to be analyzed – so plan accordingly.

You may think that more is better and that you just could shorten each session, ask fewer questions and skip observing the participants.
But you need time if you want to find out about the »how« and »why« of the participants’ work . Several sessions in hurry will lead to less useful results than research with one participant done right.
Nevertheless, only doing research on very few users will restrict the variance of data – like noticing that there may be several ways to do the same thing.
As well you might not see which patterns are consistent among several people and which vary – which would certainly be impossible if you only had one participant.

There are no clear cut rules of how many participants are enough.
However, most of my projects have between 3 and 8 participants.
If I really need to be sure that what I notice is consistent I'd do research with 10, but that is about the limit I can manage on my own.

An efficient way of involving the »right« amount of participants is doing your research iteratively: start with three or four participants and analyse the data (how this is done is descibed in the section on [Analysing Data](#Analysis))

Take a look at the (preliminary) findings: If the results seem clear and consistent, you may do research with few additional participants to refine and check and to explore details – or, if time is up, leave it the way it is.

If preliminary findings are unclear or contradictory, you may need to involve more participants.

Reasons for the such unsatisfactory results could be:

* Your research encompasses different groups of people with different needs – For example the groups students and professors share some traits, but many characteristics will vary.
* The topic of your research is too broad – for example, »How do people do design« is very broad, »How do interface designers involve specifications of user research and engineers in their designs« is more specific.
* Even if your research is focused and there is only one group of people involved, the actual patterns just vary.

In all these cases you can involve more participants – but before you do involve more participants try to check if you…

* …need to clarify your research topic (to focus your efforts)
* … need to specify the involved groups (to recruit the right participants)
