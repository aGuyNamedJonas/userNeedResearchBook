# About this text

This book is written for all those who want to design products according to the needs of human beings. This text teaches you how to find potential users and how to find out about their activities, motivations and problems. I demonstrate how to analyze the gathered data in a way that makes it usable and useful for you design process.
 
To have knowledge about the »how« and »why« of the user’s work allows you to create innovative products that meet the users’ needs. As well, you can utilize this knowledge to improve existing products.

I try to teach methods for user needs research in a way that is descriptive and allows quick application of the learned methods by using tools that are readily available to you. I give examples to demonstrate the use of methods in practice. I hope you can imagine yourself applying the describes methods when reading – and I want to avoid teaching something that seems like mere theory to you. 

Don’t get me wrong (especially if you are a seasoned researcher for user needs or a professional in some other social science field). It is not that I think theory is superfluous and should be avoided by practitioners. I just want to empower beginners by provide a start in the field which is hands-on and leads to visible results.


# Find People 
In user research we want to find out what our users do and how and why  they do it.   If we know this, we can design our products accordingly. 

To be able to do research on the »how« and »why« of user’s work, you need to find some users who would like to answer your questions and would demonstrate some tasks. These users are our (research) participants. (Your participants may be called your »sample«, in contrast to all those who could be possibly be participants, the »population«. So a sample – some users – is a part of the population – all possible users) 

## Who are possible participants?

The participants in your research need to be similar to the possible users of your final product. If you plan to create an app for people to create bibliographies it makes sense that the participants are students or researchers. If you plan to design a skateboard try to find people who skate. The point is that you need to make up your mind who might give you the information about the how and why of the activities you want to support with your product.

When selecting possible participants, I recommend doing a check based on (assumed) user behavior. Ask yourself: Are the people that may participant in your research likely to…

- …do the tasks the people do who should use your final product? 
- …have similar problems?
- …have similar motivations? 

I assume that you don't have the money to employ a recruiting agency to get your participants. Thus you will need to find and ask them yourself. Especially if you are on your own you may need to compromise and do research with participants that don't match your intended users exactly. When doing this, keep in mind to  check for similarity of tasks, problems and motivations . These checks don't ensure that the participants are exactly the ones who may use your final product. But you can be rather sure that they can tell you something that is of interest for you.

If you design an app for people to create bibliographies and you can only get some bachelor and masters students, but no professors, your results will still reveal a lot about the processes of creating bibliographies. Assuming that the student’s motivation is probably writing final term papers and that the professors would write  journal papers is a possible difference but as long as you aware of it, you are probably o.k.  But if you want to design a skateboard and the only participants you can get are all elderly people who enjoy hiking your research you are in trouble (if you find elderly people who enjoy skating, go for it…).

## How can I find participants?

Think of methods to make possible participants aware of your research and the possibility to participate. For example, participants could be found among

- employees of other departments 
- friends and family 
- the people who see your posts on social media
- the people who visit your or your companies homepage
- participants of meetings/gatherings.

To find the right participants for your research, try to find out where those people are: users of a particular software can be found on mailing lists, forums and user meetups. Young adults could be found via bulletin boards on campus. Retired people may be found in church congregation and retirement homes. 

Inform possible participants about the study and what they can expect when they participate. Regardless of how you inform them – if by speaking directly to them, by using a note on a blackboard or by writing an eMail –  you should give them the following information: 

- The purpose of the study 
- the research method (answering questions and observation)
- the time frame (ranging usually from 30min-2h)
- incentives (if you can afford it)
- your contact information 



<div class="example">
**Are you a designer?**

We, a team of students of the Weimar University,  want to improve the free layout program frame drawer and want the application to match your workflow and needs. Therefore we would like to gather some insights in the way you work. 

If you would like to support us, someone from our team would visit your workplace and ask you some questions and look over your shoulder while you work. This would take approximately 1h.

All participants get a $10 voucher for the university's cafeteria.
If you would  like to participate (or have further questions) please write a mail to jan.dittrich@example.com

</div>

When using such ways of recruiting be sure to comply to the rules of the organizations or social groups involved. It does not help your research if the community you target gets cross with you for violating their privacy and customs. If you are unsure, just ask. These people you ask, lets say a clergyman or a meetup organizer may even be able to set you up with people who can help you. Once you started your reserach you can ask  participants if they know other people who match your ideas of possible participants. It is likely that they know some other people who work in the same job or have similar hobbies. This is called »snowball sampling«: The more people you ask the more additional people you get and you could ask those as well. This is like a snowball which, when rolled, gains more and more snow the bigger it gets. However, don't be afraid of an avalanche of participants, usually everyone you ask only knows some people and these may or may not respond. Just stop asking additional ones when you think the amount of participants is right. 

## How many participants do I need?

When estimating how many participants you need,  consider how many resources (time and/or money) you can spend on doing the research. Each additional participant gives you additional data and a broader view on your possible users. However, each research session needs time do and adds to the amount of data to be analyzed – so plan accordingly. 

You may think that more is better and that you just could shorten each session, ask fewer questions and skip observing the participants. However, if we want to find out about the »how« and »why« of the participants’ work we need time, and several sessions in hurry will lead to less useful results than research with one participant done right. Nevertheless, only doing research on very few users will restrict the variance of data – like noticing that there may be several ways to do the same thing. As well you might not see which patters are consistent among several people and which vary – which is certainly not possible if you would only have one participant. 

There are no clear cut rules of how many participants are enough. However, most of my projects have between 3 and 8 participants. If I really need to be sure that what I notice is consistent I'd do research with 10, but thats about the limit I can manage on my own. 

You can consider doing your research iteratively: start with three or four participants and begin with the analysis as soon as possible (steps like writing your comments to the data or even starting to create possible grouping is possible after having the data of at least two participants). Take a look at the first (preliminary) findings: are the patterns repeating themselves and are they consistent between participants and situations? Or do they vary widely? If they are consistent, you may do research with few additional participants to refine and check and to explore details – or, if time is up, leave it the way it is. 

If preliminary findings vary and it is hard to see any patterns consider involving more participants and  review the scope and goal of your research. It is possible that there is just a variety of patters and the need for more users to make sense of the data. But it could as well be the case that your research focus is very broad and hard to research. In this case try to narrow down the focus and the activities you need to know about before involving the next batch of participants. 

# Prepare the session  

## What do your want to find out?  {#questiontopics}

Before you collect the data, decide what you want to find out. Let's
look at some topics that might be of interest exploring:

I usually have three aspects I think of when I prepare my questions:

1.  Activities, things the user does
2.  Motivations, what the user wants to archive, what is important for
    him/her
3.  Problems: things that interfere with the users activities and
    motivations

There could be many other aspects, but I find these three good because 
* they  cover a wide range of possible topics questions
* they cover design relevant topics
* three points are easy enough to remember even in the midst of
research.


When thinking about what you want to find out, keep in mind that user
need research is not hypothesis testing (like when doing statistics for
a scientific publications). You want to find out new things, especially
such that you did not know about nor expected. Thus these questions are
a starting point.

Let me show you the questions I came up with for finding out about the
needs of designers who create layouts.

####  Activities

<div class="example"> 

-   Can you describe the task you are currently working on?
-   Can you show me how you create a graphic/layout?
-   Can you show me how you use the application?

</div>

Talking about activities or observing them is a very rich source of
information. When asking about activities you can often use  follow up questions 
to find out why and how users do what they do: *»You said, you apply paragraph styles. What do they do?«* 
or *»You just used that›align‹ function – before you placed objects
manually. What is the difference between those activities?.«*

####  Motivations

<div class="example">

-   Can you describe the worst experience in your day so far?
-   Can you describe the best experience in your day so far?
-   Which tasks in your job do you like the least?
-   Which tasks in your job do you like the most?
-   Can you show me a piece of work you are proud of?

</div>

Questions about Motivations are usually about emotions and often their
relation to activities as well. You can explore  these relations further in follow-up questions 
( »You said you hate talking with this client. What in particular makes it a bad experience for you?« )

####  Problems

<div class="example">

-   Can you describe a situation in which you feel hindered by the tools
    you are using?
-   When do you feel hindered or slowed down?
-   Can you show me how you circumvent this from happening?

</div>

Asking for problems provides some good starting points for designing (as
you can try to avoid the problems with a better solution). The answers
will tell you something about the motivations of the user too (e.g. »I
would like to… but I can’t do this, because…«).

Naturally, the three general aspects of activities, motivations and
problems are just giving you a starting point for developing your questions.
Use them to create questions suitable for you own research.

When you have started with gathering data you can further refine your
questions. You will get new ideas or want to refine questions since you tried them
and may notice shortcomings or opportunities.
 For example, in the research on graphic design I noticed that idea
generation during work was important for the participants and an interesting topic to research.
Thus I added questions like »how do you generate new ideas« or »How do
you know if an idea you have works?«. Note that I did not
ask directly »do you generate ideas while implementing designs«. This
would be a question that  urges to be answered with »yes« or »no«. Such short
answers give no context. But we need the context, the reasons for
actions and the course of events to know not only how work is done but why it is done, too

In later sections we will have a further look at the does and dont’s of
questions.



## Write a cheat sheet  

You should ensure that questions you prepare are still on your mind when
doing the interview. A good way to ensure this is to taking a cheat sheet along.

What goes into such a sheet? The biggest part will be **questions** which you
created beforehand (take a look at [»What do your want to find out?«](#questiontopics)  for 
collecting possible questions). When you write the questions on the cheat sheet, 
start with the general topics and progress towards more specific ones. 
This is the order that makes sense in the course of a research session. 
Nevertheless, that order is only a helpful guess. You will usually deviate a bit (or a lot) from your cheat
sheet.

Often I include some kind of **checklist** on the top, especially if
there are legal matters involved, such as signing a consent form. Thus I
can tick off what we already dealt with and immediately see if I forgot something.

As a beginner you may have some difficulties with formulating your
questions without preparations when spontaneously entering on a new subject that
happens to emerge in the research session. 

In this case you can help yourself along with some reminders on the sheet, like
»Activities/Motivations/Problems«, »How and Why«, or, for the graphics design topic:
»creativity/variations/creative rules/technology« or the like.

## Equipment  

With a participant ttalks about new and interesting things you want to
be able to remember what was said. Thus we record the interview – and we
will need some equipment for doing that. Lets have a look.

![Equipment for user research: paper, pen, audio recorder](images/interviewEquipment.svg)

### Note taking  


During the interview and observation you will take notes. For taking
notes you need:

-   Paper, lined or blank (15 or more sheets, just to be on the save side)
-   Pencil or Pen (Don't forget to bring backups!)
-   Something to write on. A clipboard is great.

### Audio Recording  

Audio record you interview to have a backup in case you could not keep
up with taking notes and to be able to fully concentrate on the
participant if needed. Either use your smartphone and an audio 
recording app or use an audio recorder. Try before if the audio on the recording 
is still loud and clear enough if you have an arm’s length between you and the device. 
Charge the devices fully.


### Camera

A camera is not a must but can be useful, especially if your research
involves much participant observation or if you don’t feel confident
about your sketching skills.

# Data Gathering  

In this chapter we will learn how to gather data to get to know about
the activities, motivations and problems of our research participants.

Contrary to a common misconception of user need research, our inquiry
will not be (directly) about future ideas and design – we are will not 
ask »do you think that a [gadget] would help you?«.  yes, you *could* ask
whether a particular thing would be a great to have in the future. But then you  
would have to ask again for the next idea you have. Furthermore, it
is very hard to reliably guess if something would be a great thing to
have in the future. Instead of dealing with ideas directly we will find
out about the how and why of our participant’s activities and thus set a reliable foundation
for our designs.

Think of your participants as as competent in what they do. This is contrary to the idea of
designers and programmers as people who improve the lives of those who
»don’t get it«. Instead, we assume that the participants of our research
have a reason of doing their work the way they do it. We try to find out
these reasons behind their activities. 

Getting to know the »how« and »why« of the users actions will allow us to
evaluate our ideas (does it match their ideas of good work?) and to get
inspiration for new ideas (how can we support this motivation?)


## Inform and get Consent

When you have found a participant, a place, a time and have your equipment ready
we can start with the actual research session. 

It is pretty straight forward: be friendly. If you come to
their place (which is preferable, since you can observe the actual
context) be a nice guest; if they come to your place or you meet in some
»neutral space«, be a nice host.

Greet the participant and thank for his/her time:


<div class="example">

Hello Lisa, great to meet you. I’m pleased, that you could free some
time for showing and telling me how you work.

</div>

You may sprinkle in a bit of smalltalk:

<div class="example">Did you have a good start into the day?</div>

Participants should at least roughly know what the research is
about. You don't need to reveal all your questions and topics
 but the general topic should be described

<div class="example">

This reserach helps us to improve the workflow in the design process in order to be
able to design solutions for people who do graphic design.

</div>

Make clear that you are here to learn – and not an evaluator of the
quality of the participant’s work.

<div class="example">

…Therefore we'd like to get to know how you work. You are an expert in
 that field and we'd like to learn from you. This is not some kind of
 test – when I ask questions there are no wrong answers

</div>

Although you may have described the timeframe and the method already
when recruiting, tell the participant what you are going to do

<div class="example">

We will have a conversation about your work and I'll be asking some
questions. In addition, I’m interested in watching you when you do your work. 
The whole process will take about an hour of time. 

</div>

The participant must know how you record data and who will see it. So
tell the Participant:

<div class="example"> 

I'd like to take notes, and, in addition, record audio – if that is
ok with you. The audio recording helps me to focus on your work as I
 don’t need to concentrate as much on writing notes, if I have the
 recording as backup. Me and a colleague will listen to the audio;
  we will anonymize and transcribe the data before we share
 it with the product design team.

If you feel uncomfortable with being recorded at any time we can pause
 the recording.

You can cancel the interview at any time if you feel it is needed.

</div>

I had rarely someone who did not agree to being recorded. If that
happens you can ask if they have any specific worries – possibly you can
inform them about that specific aspect and they might agree when they
have  additional information.

<div class="example">

[Example from an in-house research project] »Audio recording… I’m not sure about this…« 
»Thats fine with me. Though, may I ask what worries are?« »Hmm…yeah, I don't like, you know, human
 resources to get that data«
 
 »I understand your concern. It is fine if you don't agree but I can
 assure you that Human Resources is a separate section. We don't share
 personal data and what we record today is not accessible to them. Also, all data
 that leaves my computer or the one of my colleague is being anonymized
 and we remove all data that points to you as person, including names,
 workplace and so on.

</div>

If they don’t agree, just stick with writing notes.

Consider summarizing the information about the research and the use of
the participant's data in a consent form that the user signs. In this
case keep the signed form, but hand the participant a copy of the form.
Thus the agreement is clear for both sides. See in the Appendix for an
[example of such a form](#consentForm). 

When you got the consent of the participant you can start the research
session.

## Modes of gathering data  

### Getting answers  

<!-- Gathering information by listening to the participant’s answers is similar to  a
conversation: You ask questions, the user answered them. --> 



We gather data by asking questions and listening to the participant’s answers.
However, the use of questions and answers in user needfinding is unlike the questions and answers in surveys. In surveys it is often aimed for short, definitive
answers out of a determined set of possbilities (»on a 4 point scale: how much do you
agree with…«). Instead of this, we aim for longer answers that are give »free« and not from a determined set of answers. Thus we are more likely to get rich descriptions, much like veritable stories
which retell the participant’s experiences. In addition, these stories  tell us about the context of the user’s activities and the user’s motivations. To encourage giving such story like answers,  we will often ask for *descriptions* of activities and the *reasons* for doing them.


 <div class="example">

»can you describe me how you decided to use this layout?«

»You said that you need to look that color model up. Why?«

</div>

Asking questions and getting answers form a participant is a very versatile
tool. It can be done without many resources. You are not tied to a specific place and 
you can talk about past events as well as future plans. 

But because of this it can happen that you hardly focus on actual occurrences and
experiences. Observations are thus a good supplement to asking questions and listening, since observations are naturally concern actual actions you can see happening at the very moment.

### Observation  

What Participants describe is not always the ideal way to convey the
information. Just like a picture can be worth a thousand words, it makes
often sense to just ask participants to show what they mean and to demonstrate
how they work.

Often it is easier for a research participant to just do what they do
anyway instead of verbalizing it. It generates more information for you as
well. It is more vivid, and the potentially distorting step of translating a
process into a description is no longer required. When you observe, you
will even notice things your participants would never consider
mentioning: It may have become second nature for them which tools they use, 
how they apply these tools to their work and 
which problems they meet. As well, you may notice interesting properties of the
context like means of communicating with co-workers or cues in the
environment that point out problems – for example quick fixes 
with tape, or added instructions on devices and machines. 


It is not needed to have observation as a seperate step in the reserach process. 
It makes great sense to interveave it with asking questions and listening to the user. 
Instead asking for descriptions of processes or tool, you can ask for a demonstration.

 <div class="example">

Participant: »So I got this image and now I would try to get a
suitable crop for that flyer«
 
Researcher: »Can you show me how you do it?«

</div>


Think of yourself as an apprentice of the participant. The participant
is the master or expert who can teach you some of his/her skills. 
This means that understanding the user by observing is not a passive process. 
Like an apprentice you can and should ask questions.

<div class="example">

Ask about reasons: »You drew that object and changed it size, then you
deleted it again… what was the reason behind this?

Ask about things you notice in the environment: »Can you tell me what
these markings are for?«

</div>

Teaching an apprentice is not a theoretical or artificially set up
process:

<div class="example">

The tasks you observe should be tasks the participant is actually doing 
(and not something set up for you): 

Participant: »What should I do now?«

You: »What would you do if I would not be here?«

Naturally they should be relevant to your interests as well: 

[continuing the conversation above] Participant: »I would either crop this bunch of images
 or I'd try to find a suitable font for the headlines in this document

You: »If the tasks are equally relevant to you I'd be more interested in watching you 
choosing the fonts«

</div>

Avoid positioning yourself as the expert in the participant’s domain by suggesting
 procedures and by telling the participant  how and why something should be done. 
If the participant would just look up to you and your concept of how work should be done we would not get to know anything.


![observing the user’s work](images/ObservationDesign1.jpg)

## Building trust

In this section I demonstrate how you can show that you value the 
participant’s time and input and make the participant  feel comfortable during the research.  

User researchers ask lots of possibly awkward feeling questions and at
least in the beginning, a research session could be unusual for some
participants. In this section we are going to look at some ways to
ensure that the research session will be a pleasant experience.

### Start with simple questions  

Start simple with some demographical questions  – like like: *»Lets start with
some simple questions about your job«*. You could ask *»What is your job
title«* and maybe follow *»How do you name your Job when friends ask you
what you do?«.* As well it might be interesting how experienced the
person is: *»How long have you been working in your current
occupation?«* These examples are tied to work related studies – for
doing research on university students I tie the questions to their
particular context and ask for example how long they have been studying
so far.

A very obvious advantage of these questions is that they will help you
to get to know some context of the participant’s work. But there is
another advantage: Such questions like asking for the job title or years in the job 
 etc. are easy  to answer and it is a pretty clear how to answer to them. This gets
the participants into the mode of answering questions and opening up
towards you. After a brief section with these easy-to-answer questions 
you can  transition into more open questions.

### Affirm that you listen  

You will ask questions aiming for descriptions and longer answers. So
you will be listening to the participant most of the time. 
You probably have some ways to intuitively show that you listen
 – like nodding with the head or saying »yes« or »mm-mhh«. 
 This is an important way to ensure the participant that his/her information 
 is listened to and valued.

However, when giving this kind of feedback you should be careful though
not to skew the answers by indicating that some information is better
than other. If you throw in a »yes, great« combined with nodding (as if you
prefer what the participant did in comparsion to something else) or if you 
just make a rather unmotivated »mm« and frown (as if what is
told does not match your expectations) the participant will get
selective about his/her answers and focus on stuff you seem to like. Try
to keep the reassuring sounds or gestures neutral towards the
information you get. 

Same goes for longer intersections at the end of an
answer. Intuitively you may say:

<div class="example">

»It was great to hear that you exchange files by mail!« (Since you may
have already thought of a feature that might be helpful in that case)

</div>

But the participant will try to be a nice person him/herself and
probably try to make you happy by going on about the problems with files
in mails even though sending files per mail is possibly not that bad in the participant’s view. 
Instead of  reassuring the participant using  judgments and emotions, focus on the 
fact that you got information you that helps you:

<div class="example">

»That was interesting to hear –«

</div>

Possibly you could even wrap the information up »So you…« and/or refer
to an area you like further information about. So it will be clear
that you care for the information and listened well – without casting
some judgement on what was told to you. 

### Body Language  

Make a friendly impression by using body language. Probably you would not
make a bad impression anyway, but let’s go through it nevertheless:
Don't give an angry or stern impression by frowning and crossing arms
and legs. Don't look careless by leaning back and looking to the
ceiling. During the interview, show reactions to what the participants says or does  and look him/her
in the eyes (at least for members of western culture). When taking notes,
maintaining eye contact is not possible all the time – but keep eye contact when you can.


![not-so-good posture](images/bodyPostureBad.jpg)

![much better posture](images/bodyPostureGood.jpg)

### Just ask  

Even if you got the consent to audio record and make photos or
video ask, before you start the recording.

<div class="example"> 

»I'd start the recording, if thats o.k.« (go ahead if there are no
 objections)
 
 »May I take a picture?«

</div>

Usually I fade out the length of thesequestions once the participant agreed,
so the next time I'm photographing and I see no obvious obstacles (an
obstacle might be a blueprint for a project under construction on screen
or desk or anything else that is more confidential than what one would
usually expect), I go with »May I…« the next time and fade out asking
each time. Ask not only for recording activities – it goes for all other
activities of yours you feel unsure about: just ask. By that, you show
respect and care for the participant and you avoid arkward
situations.
  

## Asking open questions  

You may have noticed that the suggested questions from the previous
section are not aiming for specific, short answers. In situations differen from user need reserach
 you often  want answers to be short and precise: 
 »Are you a graphic designer?« »I am a Graphic Designer!« / »How
much do you like your Job? Give a mark« »B!« / »Please name your Tools!«
»InDesign, Photoshop«.

If you would diagram who speaks for how long when we ask for specific
information with a »closed« range of possibilities, it would
look like this:

![short closed questions](images/talkDiagram_closed.svg)

These questions demand very specific answers mostly out of a determined
set: Yes or no, marks from A-F, a list of nouns. They would be useful if
you would want to do statistics, for analysis leading to statements
like »56.3% agreed strongly on Question X«. However, we want to find out
about the *why* and *how* of the participant’s work here.

Imagine, in contrast to the research session outlined above (short
answers, short questions) a day-to-day situation, in which you get to
know about somebody else’s experiences: A conversation with a friend. In
such an exchange you will tell each other about your experiences, what you
felt, why you did this and that etc. In a diagram it would look like
this:

![giving longer aswers, equal share](images/talkDiagram_friend.svg)

In contrast to a conversation, our main goal is to collect data; we
don’t want to tell about our Job as a user researcher, but
mostly hear answers from the participant. Thus asking questions and
getting answers in a user needs research session look like this:

![participant gives long answers, researcher asks short, open questions](images/talkDiagram_open.svg)


The questions we want to ask should encourage answers which describe
experiences and give some insight into the »why« and »how« of the users
activities and motivations. This type of question is called »open
question« since these questions don’t have a determined set of answers.

<div class="example">

Open questions would be: *"Describe how you started your work today"*
or *"Why did you copy that page?"*

</div>

Using such open questions encourage telling longer, story-like
answers. These answers will even contain information you did not expect
to get.

<div class="example">

A participant is describing me the printing process: *»…then I look up
 which color specification the printery needs…«* That is a new step
in the workflow I did not expect (Naively, I thought that you just send
the document to the printery like you would when you print it on your desktop printer – have a file, print it). Thus I discovered a step in the workflow and a potential field of work
(taking care of color spaces and profiles) of which I did not know
that it even exists!

</div>

The information you get will not be abstract as in answers like »good«
or »I dislike it« but tied to a situation. This is preferable, because a
future product will be used in real situations and not in an abstract
space of thought.

<div class="example">

»I like it when the feedback [to the design] comes quickly. No annoying
waiting… it always makes me nervous. Do they [the client] like it or
do I need to throw out work?« – this tells us more about the situation
than a client’s feedback being just described as »good«.

</div>


If you look back to the questions already mentioned, they will share some
characteristics.

<div class="example">

here are some of the questions

-   Can you describe the worst experience in your day so far?
-   Can you tell me how you create a layout?
-   Can you tell me what makes a client »difficult«
-   Can you describe how do you get new ideas?

</div>

All these questions start with »…can you describe« or »…can you tell me«, which
encourages a longer answer (»describing« or »telling« is something needs usually more than one word). In addition, all sentences contain a *Why-*, *What-* or *How-*. These
question words, again, suggest an elaborate answer, not just one
or two words.

Thus, a template for such questions would look like *»tell me [how/why/what] +
interest«*

Contrast this with questions like

<div class="example">

You: »Is this a good design?«

Paricipant: »yes!«

</div>

*»Is…«* -questions will be answered with »yes« or »no« – but we don't
get to know *why* the participant to agrees or disagrees with our
assumption.

Sometimes,  »Is«-Questions will  come in a disguised
form – as an addition which is made to an open question:

<div class="example"> 

You: »Can you tell me how you solve this problem? …Do you do it by just
 calling the client and resolving the issue?« 
 
 Participant: »Yes, I do« 
 
 Please note that the question did not contain the word »is«, but follows the same pattern of
 asking for a binary »yes« or »no« response.

</div>

Avoiding closed questions is actually harder than one thinks. We intuitively try
to make answering easier with such additions like »Do you […]«.

When you create your questions check if they demand some predetermined
outcomes – if the do, they are closed questions. In this case reformulate the questions in a way 
that allows non-restricted, story-like answers.

## Overcoming problems  

There are some problems that are likely to arise when you gather data.
Knowing the problems and some ways of dealing with them will help you.

### Be aware of your influence

A very obvious problem is influencing the participant. One way to minimize this would be
making all research sessions alike – just like you would do when using a
standardized questionnaire. But doing this you would loose the very strengths of the methods 
described here: Being able to find out about new and unexpected things and reacting to them 
and gaining some understanding of the »how« and »why« by asking questions and looking 
for cues depending on the situation. 

Each participant and his/her context is different and you can accommodate this by 
adjusting the research session to the context and the activities of the user. 
This would not be possible when asking the same questions each time. 

So you neither can’t nor should take yourself out of the reserach session – you will always have some sort of effect on the participant when you do the reserach. 

What you should avoid though is influencing the participant by
»suggesting« favourable answers or actions. Some sorts of this type of  influence are obvious,
others are not.

<div class="example">

»This is good, isn’t it?!«

</div>

Is a very obvious influence, since it blatantly states what you
think the answer should be: A »yes«. 

There are less obvious influences as well:

<div class="example">

»Would you like a better version of this with a big button here?«

</div>

In this example, a positive word (»better«) and a suggestion go together. Who would
not like an improvement?! A »yes« is guaranteed – as well as a meaningless
finding which would be »people want improvements«.

Aside from your questions you could influence the user with your
feedback since it might suggest that there are »good« and »bad« answers.
For example, it may be tempting to correct users and show the »right
way« of doing something:

<div class="example">

If you know that there is a »change color« function in the application
and the user says: »Well; I am annoyed by that application – I'd like
to change the colors but they are fixed!« It may be tempting to
say: »No, you can change it!«

</div>

Remember that you want to find out what your participant does and why. To
correct the participant is not very useful.  Use the possibility to further explore the topic
without correcting the user ^[If, however, the participant would
clearly benefit from knowing some technical detail, just give the crucial information
 after the session] .

<div class="example">

You could just ask »What is useful about a change color function«, or,
if talking about the function itself is really is important to you, you
could ask »How did you expect to do the color change if there would be such a function?«

</div>

Similarly, you could be surprised or even annoyed by steps or actions
in a workflow of the user which seem outright superfluous.

<div class="example">

»When I write a text I write a draft and then send it to my colleague
via mail as an attached .doc file. My colleague comments on it and
returns the mail to me« You may think that this is rather inefficient.
You could be tempted to say »Why don't you paste the text in the mail
and comment directly? Or write it live on Etherpad? This would be far
quicker!«

</div>

Remember that nobody does inefficient things by purpose. Assume that the
user has a reason. Try to find out what this reason may be.

<div class="example">

»What is good about that workflow?« or »Did you ever try an
alternative workflow« or »can you think of other ways that might be
feasible?« – and remember to ask follow-up question to further explore
the issue.

</div>

Your influencing feedback could be non-verbal as well. Like in everyday
conversations you may shrug or frown if you disagree with an
utterance or an action. Even if you don’t say »this is wrong«, frowning
or shaking your head may have the same results. 

So: don't be afraid to react towards the participant – reacting towards the participant is 
essential in our research. But don’t suggest »good« or »bad« answers or 
»good« or »bad« activities using words, gestures or facial expressions.  

### Silence feels strange but is o.k.  

Sometimes, the participant will take time to think before answering.
Intuitively, you may want to fill the silence to help the participant
along.

<div class="example">

»Can you describe me what happened after you were finished with
creating the print-ready-file? [1 sec] Was it all well?« »yeah, sort
of well I think«

</div>

It is tempting to fill the silence with suggestions for the answer. But
it can skew the answers and can turn a open question (»can you
describe…?«) into a closed question (»can you describe… was it…?«
/»yes«).

Try to tolerate the silence. Usually, the participant will
answer within a few seconds. If you notice silence which you want to fill, count
to 3 or 5 before probing further. When the set time is up, you can ask
about the question rather than giving suggestions, like

<div class="example">

What makes the question hard to answer?

</div>

Or 

<div class="example">

Can you tell me what you are thinking about?

</div>

If the participant has started to give an answer already but stops talking and makes a longer pause and you still like to know more, you could »echo« the most recent statement or words the participant has said.

<div class="example">

Participant: »So I had it finished and send it away to the client and then almost nothing… [Pause]« 

Researcher: »almost nothing?«

</div>

This is a technique to make people carry on without skewing their
answer.

<div class="example">

Researcher:»almost nothing?« 

Participant: »Yes, there was a brief mail that they got the
 design but I was unsure if that person actually gave it to
 the people who can decide something. That waiting just sucks.«

</div>

### Keep your questions simple

Questions should be simple to understand and only one question should be asked at
once. 

 <div class="example">

Can you describe how you align these elements? What is good about the
 resulting design?

</div>

The question asks two things at once. This is has some disadvantages:

1.  It confuses the interviewee – what should be answered first?
2.  Both, Interviewer and Interviewee need to remember both questions while talking and listening

So, one question should be asked at once. In the example above one question
should be asked first, then the second:

 <div class="example">
 
 »Can you describe how you align these elements?« [Answer]

»What is good about the resulting design? « [Answer]

</div>

## Don't make the user the designer

It is tempting to skip investigating the »how« and »why« of the
participant’s work and to ask the participant instead directly  
how the final product should be like

 <div class="example">
 
 Which function do you need for aligning objects?
 
 </div>

This is basically asking the user for the design of the software.

 <div class="example">
 
 Yes, there should be a button for, like equal distributions… here.
It should be easy, so it should have a button with a ›distr‹ on it in
red, so I don’t oversee it…

</div>

Asking the user for a design sounds like a reasonable thing to do – the resulting
designs would be directly based on the suggestions of the participant.

But it usually leads to disastrous results. Even for experienced
designers it may be hard to come up with a good interface which is easy
to learn and efficient to use. And even experienced designers take time, often creating 
multiple versions which are then tested. How should somebody inexperienced in that task 
come up with a great interface spontaneously?

Another (highly tempting) way of »making the participant the designer«
is to ask for the usefulness of hypothetical functions that you fancy yourself:

<div class="example">

Would a function for choosing a color scheme help you?

</div>

This is like asking »Do you want an additional tool which might be
useful at some point and get it for free?«. If the participant can think
of a few occasions in which such a tool *might* be useful, the answer
will be »yes«. In addition,nothing can be found out about the »how« and »why« of the
participant's work – just like with other questions that ask for »yes«
or »no« outcomes. 

If you *really* want to discuss a function instead of focusing on what the
participant does and why this is done, give some context to the question and tie it to a
specific situation.

 <div class="example">
 
 We think of a system in which colors can be changed like you just
changed the paragraph-styles. How would such a feature be relevant or
not in the task you just described?

</div>

Thus, you can get more information on the tasks for which the feature could be
useful. The question is not tied to all possible
situations but to a specific  one.

Asking the user for design ideas and functions is tempting but rarely
useful. If possible, avoid it and concentrate on the finding about how and why they 
work the way they do. If you really need to ask for designs or function ideas, tie
them to a specific context and ask for descriptive answers instead of
asking if something in general might be good or not.

## Referring back  

In this section I will demonstrate how to maintain flow and elicit
further information by referring to previous answers or demonstrations.  

### Referring back  for further elaboration

![continue with same topic by referring back to someting just said](images/talkDiagram_ReferBackDirect.svg)

A typical use of that method is asking for further information on
something that was mentioned and which interests you in particular. 
In this case, refer back to the information and ask for elaboration.

Here are some examples:

 <div class="example">
 
 That typography settings – you said they are far more precise than the
 ones in wordprocessors. Can you explain me how these differences help you to
 design compared to the ones in wordprocessors?

</div>

or

 <div class="example">
 
 You said that you would continue with setting up the ›masterpage‹. Can you show me how?

</div>



### Referring back  for further elaboration

![change the topic by referring to something said some time ago](images/talkDiagram_ReferBackDistance.svg)

You can refer back to the answer which was just given and
continue with the same topic. But referring back can be used as well to provide a transition between
*different* topics. This is especially useful if the participant is
talking about something that deviates much from what you are interested
in. By referring to something previously mentioned or demonstrated you can show
that you have been attentive and thus make the topic change less
intrusive:

 <div class="example">
 
 »…so this was a design made by some artist. It was really wired, I shared the office with him for some time. He always came with that dog of him which…« »Hmm…you previously talked about creating a cover for the book – you said that you try several designs. Can you describe how you try them?«

</div>

### Referring back to check your understanding

You can refer back to answers to check your grasp of what
the participant talked about. In this case, even closed questions are ok.

 <div class="example">
 
 »I saw you choose the color from that palette down there – is this the
same palette you choose the background color from?« »No, it is not –
the palette I am using here is…«

</div>

or

 <div class="example">
 
 »So: If I want to print something first I need to ask for their color
profile, when I have this, I load it in InDesign, choose the profile
in the pdf dialog and then export it?« »Yes. I usually to a test
afterwards by opening the pdf in addition«

</div>

\
\

These techniques explained here involve jumping back to some previously
mentioned topic. This may seem difficult, since you need to remember some
particular information (to refer to it later)  while carrying on with the research. 
However, it is not that hard – just give it a try. As well, keep in mind that you can 
make brief notes reminding you of things that are of interest. With a look on your 
note sheet they will return to your memory in case you 
forgot about them.


## How exactly would you do it?  


After you ask a question,  participants will sometimes answer *»in general«*

 <div class="example">
 
 »In general, I have a workflow of these steps: Research, Ideation,
Creation, Evaluation. So in research I…«

</div>

It may seem great – after all, a general process which you can apply to
just about anything is a finding we seem want! But actually these *»in
general«* descriptions pose some problems: Since they are general and thus abstract 
they lack a rich context and stand rather disconnected to other 
activities or motivations. A general principle is independent of  
such »minor« day to day things. But these seemingly trivial informations about the 
context of activities  give us the insights we need to find out why and how the participant is doing something in the real, particular situation. Such »general« procedures may as well be heavily idealized and rarely applied in the way they are described.

A way to get  real-world, rich data is to ask for an example. Thus you 
don’t blatantly reject the »general« answer but you convey that you are interested and
want to understand it better:

 <div class="example"> 
 
 Can you show me an example of how you put that principles into
 practice?

</div>

You can as well ask  for a specific occasion of the »general« happening or being
done. The answer will be give the context of the activities happening in an actual situation.

 <div class="example">
 
 In the magazine project – can you describe how your design process was 
 there?

</div>

Or

 <div class="example"> 
 
 »Can you show me how you do this in the project you are working on now  – if that makes sense?«

</div>

Very often you may discover that the reality is far less consistent and
far more context-depended then in the general examples. The findings are more
interesting and inspiring as well:

 <div class="example"> 
 
 Participant: »Well, in this project we have a tight deadline. So we needed to speed
 up. So I did some research… well, I reused some I did have from a
 similar project…  and talked to a fellow student who did something
 similar. And then…«

</div>

By asking for examples and specific events instead of context-free
generalizations, you can get more information and avoid doing research on
»general«, possibly not actually practiced ways of work.

![observing user’s actions after asking for a demonstration](images/ObservationDesignU3Cutting.jpg)



## Wrap it up

When you covered the topics you wanted to know about and explored them
sufficently by asking questions and observing it may be time to wrap up the research session. 

I made the experience that after 30 minutes I covered the my general questions. 
However, getting to know complex workflows takes longer. Same goes for getting deeper insights
into (work) culture. As well, using observations will need some time too. So if you go beyond a simple interview you should plan 1-2h for one research session. 

Don’t let this estimations fence you in: You will develop some
intuition for the flow of the reserach session and how long it should take. 

Keep in mind that the research session should be comfortable for the participant. 
If he/she looks absent, yawns etc. it is probably time to wrap it up.

Before I finish I go through my cheat sheet and see if I did cover my
questions.  I try to summarize what I learned from the participant
by going through my notes and verbalize the information. You can
even announce it like this:

 <div class="example">
 
 This was very interesting. To wrap it up I want to give a brief
summary of what I learned. Please feel free to correct me, if I
misunderstood something! So: Your, you said that your work is to…

</div>

By verbalizing what you learned you can fill any gaps and create fade out the research session.
When you finished going though your notes and giving your summary, thank the participant for
taking the time. If you have any incentives or compensation, give them
to the participant. In addition, I try to give an outlook on the next steps in the
research. I think it is nice to let the participant know how the data matters for
me:

 <div class="example">
 
 My next steps would be going though audio and notes. After
anonymizing what we recorded, me and my colleague analyze the data and the
data from other research sessions to find out how graphic designers work. 

We will try to improve our products by making it more suitable to this
workflow.

</div>


## Recording

### Notes and Sketches on paper


####  Notes  

![making notes on a clipboard](images/notizenKlemmbrett.jpg)


During the interview you will take brief notes. This is rather similar
like taking notes in school or university: You go for the gist of what
was said but you don't write down the exact words (Except in the case you
find an particular expression itself important). One finding, utterance or
observation goes in one line.

You can’t just look at your note sheet and write down what the participants says without ever looking at him/her. So you need to do the notetaking *in addition* to observing, listening and asking. 

If you don’t care too much about your handwriting you can write 
notes without much looking at the paper except for some occasional glances. 
In case you find something very important and fear forgetting it, you can ask the participant to 
repeat the utterance – but keep this to a minimum.

If you can, try to provide some context in your notes. Thus, the point
you write down has a meaning on it’s own:

 <div class="example">
 
 Rather than writing *»she clicks«* (what? Why?) you could write *»Clicks save button → finishes balancing the elements«* or the like.
 </div>

 <div class="example">
 
 Rather than »creates empty page« write
 »creates empty pages to organize drafts«
</div>

If your notes have a meaning on their own it will be far easier to
analyze them later.


####  Sketches  

Observations are, by nature, visual and concerned with processes. 
Make sketches or even little storyboards to
capture what you see. It depends on the situation and your capabilities
in drawing quickly (or rather, your trust in that capability). 

It is very useful that you can choose what to draw: highlight what is important,
leave out what is irrelevant and make annotations to ease understanding the sketches later.

I mostly use my sketches the same way I use notes: Notes and sketches are made on a
common sheet of paper; one sketched observation goes in one line, if
possible.

![Sketches on the note sheet](images/sketchesInNotes.png)


####  After the interview  

It is essential to take time after the research session to supplement your
 notes with information from your memory. While collecting
the data with the participant you will be very busy listening and
thinking of following questions. So you may not be able to keep up with
writing notes and drawing sketches. There is no need to worry since
usually you'll remember how to fill these gaps from your memory. But you
need to do it quickly. If you don’t do it right after the interview,
your memory fades and the chance to supplement the information is gone.

To supplement your notes of the research session just go through them
chronologically and add annotations. 

A part of these additions are things that are not in the
notes yet but still in my memory. In this case I *add* them, like

 <div class="example">
 
 [ADDITION]: 
 
 *She looks at her sketches before she starts working* 
 
 </div>

or I supplement some *existing* point with additional information:

 <div class="example">
 
 Sketching paper kept ready. \[ADDITION\]: *In transit: in the backpack; at
the workplace: right on the desk*

</div>

You can give brief notes more meaning by adding context from your
memory:

 <div class="example"> 
 
 * She saves old ideas \[ADDITION\]: For later inspiration in other
 projects *
 
 </div>

<div class="gallery four">

![](images/usersketch1.png) 

![](images/usersketch2.png) 

![](images/usersketch3.png) 

![](images/usersketch4.png) 

<p class="caption">Memory fades quickly</p>

</div>


When revising your sketches, redraw the lines if the sketch is ambiguous otherwise and add annotations if you think that they might ease interpreting the sketch later on.

Think of your future self: Some notes may make perfect sense to you now
but since memory fades, they will seem cryptic later. So supplement and
clarify your sketches and notes so you can comprehend them after your
memories of the experience have faded.

 <div class="example">

I have line *»Big changes«* in my
Notes. I remember that I made this note when the participant told me that her colleagues make bigger changes between to two versions of their designs than she does. 
I added this information to the notes, since it provided a way to understand what the »big changes«
actually refer to. 

</div>

Similarly, if my writing is rather messy, I rewrite some words to ensure
that I can later decipher what I wrote.

I write and draw my supplements in another color than the original notes. When I wrote my notes
during the interview with a blue pen I use black for the supplements or
vice versa, since I like to be able to keep track of what I did in which
step of the process.

 <div class="example">

![](images/NotesSupplements2Anno.png)
 
 In this scanned part of a note sheet you see how the supplements are
 used: **1)** These parts have been partly rewritten in black as it was too
 messy before. **2)** At the right you see an newly drawn annotated sketch
 that provides a visual representation (how the document is organized
 by inserting empty pages). **3.)** More information has been provided. It
 was »keeping for inspiration«, now its »keeping *old stuff* for
 inspiration«
 
 </div>

Using different colors is useful for another type of supplement:
Ideas or remarks in connection to your notes. When I go
through the notes I often have some ideas for a design or a question
which I would like to further explore in a future interview.  I write them down in a third color or I prefix the note with *»IDEA:«* or *»QUESTION«* in order to prevent myself of mixing ideas 
with empirical data. 

Writing notes, drawing sketches and supplementing them hereafter will
enable you to preserve information in the most situations. However, for
complicated descriptions of workflows or if you just loose track by
accident, it might be useful to have a backup by using audio recording.

####  Getting it into the computer

When I added my supplements to the notes and sketches I usually type
them in a wordprocessor document. In addition, I scan my notes, so I can easily cut
and paste my sketches into the document. 

When transcribing the note, I take care that each line in the
digital transcript has only one finding in it and not several, so that
I don't tie two separate findings together. Make sure that the
data you write down is meaningful on its own and is not just a single word or a
description which is free of any context and thus hard to set in relation
to other data.

 <div class="example">
 
Not meaningful on its own (means mostly: too short):

-   I duplicate objects
-   making space

If there is any way to add the actual context (out of the memory or using other notes) 
these notes should be supplemented with that context which hopefully helps us to get to know *why* are objects are duplicated and for *which purpose* is the space is made. 

</div>

 <div class="example">
 
 Too many findings in one line (means as well: too long):

-  Duplicating pages to save old ideas is common. Later she goes back     to the duplicates and looks at them when she needs inspiration
- Tries to have enough space for the margins to write my comments in the margins; to do so she shrinks the main text area. I could as well try to make space down here, and use footnotes for the comments.

</div>

 <div class="example">
 
 Reasonable (Meaning on its own and not multiple findings at once):

-   Duplicating objects to save old ideas for later inspiration
-   Make space for additional comments by shrinking main text area.
-   Alternative places for additional comments: Either right margin or     bottom.

</div>

The notes and later added supplements from my memory are treated alike
in my documents since they are all data I gathered by listening or observing the participant. But I take care that later added design ideas and research
questions are still easily distinguishable from the actual data that I
gathered in the research session.



####  Making Photos

Making photos is rather easy and can capture lots of information. For
example, you can photograph the participant's desk to aid your memory.
Later, you can go back and see what was on it: Paper, pens, computer;
were there tidy looking stacks and containers for all the utensils? Or
was it seemingly messy?

You can photograph the users screen if your research
involves computers and gadgets. Tech savvy users may cringe since a
software based screenshot is technically superior – but if the user does
not know you to make a screenshot, a camera is a handy way to capture
the screen.

For utilizing photos you should know how to make good or at least
o.k.ish photos with your camera quickly and reliably. Take a device you
know and which has a good auto-mode. The only setting that I use beyond
that is the exposure compensation in case an important part of the image 
totally dark or disappears in light. Exposure compenstaion allows to adjust that. 

Avoid complicated set-ups or even arranging the participant and his/her tools.
Arranging the participant and his/her tools would change the data you record.

![photographing the working user](images/NutzerFotografieren.jpg)

![photographing a screen instead of using screenshots](images/ObservationDesignU4ScreenFontMix.jpg)

After the research session go through your photos just like you went through
your notes. If it makes sense, you can use the information from the
photos to supplement your notes. It might as well useful to summarize
what one sees on the photo. These descriptions can be used more easy
than the photo itself when doing the analysis.

<div class="example">

For the photo above you might add the following line to your notes:
»participant displays different font combinations in the layout
application to see if the fonts go well together (see
U2-14-9-14\_1.jpg)«

</div>


###  Recording Audio

Unlike making notes on paper, making an audio recording is a rather
passive process except for pressing the record button.

I recommend using audio recordings – it is a useful supplement to your
notes. It will record the audio during the research session so that you
can listen to what was said hereafter. Note that it is not a perfect
capture of all that happened: It records only sound, so if the
participant points to the screen and refers to »this«, the recording is
not much of help.

After the research session I listen to the recording. Usually I
have the audio as a .mp3 and the notes as a typed out plaintext or
wordprocessor document (see *notes and Sketches on Paper*), so I can open audio and
transcript in parallel on my computer. When the audio contains information which is not in the
document or if it supplements information that is already there, I pause
the playback and write the additional information in the document. So
the process is very similar to supplementing your notes from memory.

<div class="example">

Recording: »…hmm I send it to my boss. She will check it. Now I go to
that other document, and see…«

The notes say: »Send document via mail«

So I add the information about the cause of sending the mail:\
»Send document via mail to the boss for checking.«

</div>

If you need to save time, go through your notes and see where they lack
information. Then just jump to the parts of the audio that might
complement these sections.

# Analysis

## Introduction to data analysis

### Why analysis?

In the analysis we will take a closer look at the data and organize it
after patters. By organizing after patterns the results can be remembered,
communicated and be used in design. These uses would be hardly possible
if when having several hundred single notes and observations like they
come directly from interviews and observations. Thus we use an analysis
of the data to process these notes and bring them in a usable, organized
form.

<div class="example">

Here is a part of an analyis. 

-   *Overarching principle*: using existing work for inspiration 
	-   *sub-principle*: review previous projects 
		- Data: "I have a look at an old project to see how I solved this problem…"
		- Data: Participant serches for…
		- …
	-   *sub-principle*: use other’s work  for inspiration
		- Data: "I look on google images how other calendars look like"
		- Data: browses through the book to see…
		- …
		
</div>

### Invent by principles

Maybe you know Bret Victors [talk on »Inventing on Principle«](http://vimeo.com/36579366). He shows
how he used the principle (you could as well say »motto« or »guideline«)
*»Creators need an immediate connection to what they're creating«* to
design software that allows to program or create animations – without
intermediate steps like choosing numerical values for parameters and
without the need for *imagining* how the result will be and hereafter executing it. 
Instead, in his solutions, taking actions and seeing the result happen in parallel. 

By analyzing our data we can create such principles for our own
projects. They may not as overarching and all-encompassing like Brat
Victors principle, but they will help us to guide our designs and to
evaluate them. You can ask yourself: »Does this idea follow my
principles? Does it violate some of them?« or could ask »With which
design could I realize this principle?«. Since the principles are based on our
data, they will express the actual needs of your users and not some
(potentially stereotypical) assumptions.

### What makes a principle as principle?  

The principles we derive from the data should be a statement on their
own – not just be describe a common property of the observations and
utterances (i.e. the data) they are derived from. A simple test is to ask yourself if
the principle could actually be true or false. The Principle »Colors«
probably will sum up all data which has some relation to color. Nobody
could say that the Principle »Color« is wrong. But »Colors are added later in
design« is a principle that might be true or not. Thus it makes a
statement instead of just referring to some common property like the
same tool (»file mananger«) mentioned or similarly judged things
(»good«) stuff. But what interests us is: What is the meaning of the
file manager in the user’s workflow? What causes these things to be
judged as »good«?

Statement-like themes are very valuable in design, because they have a
meaning you can test if ideas are coherent with the principle or not.
You got a design idea? Check if it makes sense in the context of the
principles you found out in user research. In need for inspiration? See
if your principles refer to problematic areas where the users activities
are clashing with the current tools.

<div class="example">

Let’s say we gathered this data (among others) in research 
with beginners in web programming:

- To try out stuff in HTML is fun
- I analyse Javascript code to understand patterns
- It is great to quickly test something using a JavaScript framework
- To know these ›attributes‹ of HTML-›tags‹ makes writing code easier.


 You could order it by superficial similarity like this:

- Utterances with HTML
	- To try out stuff in HTML is fun
	- To know these 'attributes' of HTML-'tags' makes writing code
 easier.
- Utterances with JavaScript
	- I analyze JavaScript code to understand patterns
	- It is great to quickly test something using a JavaScript  framework

These are ordered by simple word occurrence. But for designing and
inspiration it is far more useful to order them by the meaning from 
the users perspective:

- Trying out is good
	- To try out stuff in HTML is fun
	- It is great to quickly test something using a javascript framework

- Learning makes own coding better
	- I analyse Javascript code to understand patterns
	- To know these 'attributes' of HTML-'tags' makes writing code easier.

Nevertheless, just creating groups which are based on commonalities
can be an important step in the analysis. Just remember that you
should come back and try to go beyond groups based on commonalities.

</div>


### Doing the right analysis?  

The data analysis is done by inferring principles from single data
points like utterances and observations. Thus the process is empirical
(as it is based on gathered data) but if the same data is
used, analysis made by different people will differ. This is because the
result of the analysis depends on the reasonable but still individual
and debatable interpretation of the data. You could say that »looking at
last years design to quickly reuse elements« belongs to a group concerned with
»I want to save  time« or to one related to the topic of
»reviewing designs for inspiration« (given that it could serve both from
the user's perspective).

There is no right or wrong nor a clear cut criteria of being »close
enough« to the data when you create the principles and groups. Instead of
having a clear, measurable rule like »you must have 0.5 significance in
statistics, most important is that your analysis is plausible (instead
of »right« or »wrong«). 

I compare the process of analysis to building a
house from a pile of Lego® bricks. These bricks are like the
not-yet-analysed data you start with. When you build a house out of
these bricks, there is no »right« building. But neither is it a process
which is arbitrary. 

There are many, many ways to stack up the bricks – but
only a very few of these generaly possible ways will result in something that can be
plausibly called a house. 

<div class="gallery two">

![possible arrangement of bricks – but not a house](images/lego_bricksToStartWith.jpg) 

![one way to build a house](images/lego_houseFinished.jpg)

</div>

How your final Lego® house will look
like is not determined from the beginning, rather you will change
designs, move walls and sometimes try to use the same piece in different
parts of the building to try out and improve. The same things will
happen when you analyze data: There are many very many possible ways to
just arrange the data, but only some of them will create something that
is meaningful to you and others. This creation of a meaningful structure
is not determined at the beginning, but a process, just like building
your Lego® house, in which you trial, fail, find improvements and step by
step come closer to a structure you are satisfied with.



### Hierarchical organization of data  

We will analyze our data by sorting it in groups (you can as well say:
by clustering it). The data in one group will relate to a particular
theme or, better, a principle, which is common to the data in the group.

We write down this theme or principle as a title for the group. If you
analyze your data using paper notes, your titles will be written on a
sticky note of a specific color (choose one, but stick with it). If you use a
word processor, use a headline for the groups titles. 

Sometimes you will have groups which relate to a common principle themselves. In this case
it makes sense to make a group of groups. If you analyze on paper notes,
use sticky notes of a color different from the usual group sticky notes
(lets say, normal group titles go on yellow notes, titles of
groups-of-groups go on green sticky notes). If you analyze your data in
a word processor use a bigger (hierarchically higher) headline (if you
use the »headline 2«-style  for normal groups, choose "headline 1"-style for group-of-groups
titles)


## Annotate and prepare the Data  

The first step of analysis is to review your data and annotate it in
order to find possible interpretations, principles and
meaning behind the observations and utterances.

The annotations should be clearly distinguishable from data you got
directly from observation or the participant’s answers – just like other things you
did add yourself (e.g. design ideas). 

I would recommend using a word processor with a comment function. Open your transcript, mark the part
you want to annotate with your interpretation, then click the »comment«
button. If you don't use a word processor, but plaintext, use something
like *»COMMENT:«* to mark your comments; If you prefer to do your annotations
with a pen and a highlighter, print your notes with double line-spacing
to have enough room for writing.

Annotating your data is a creative process. If in doubt whether an
annotation is relevant or not: opt for writing it. Later on it might
become useful. If you are unsure about something or an idea seems to be
far fetched, just go for it. Since you keep data and comments
distinguishable from each other you can always throw stuff out again. The goal is not to
come up with great annotations but to wrap your head around the data and
to find possible ways to interpreting it.

![Annotating data in a wordprocessor](images/commentsAnalysis.png)


## Analysis: analog or digital?  

![analysing data analog by using sticky notes](images/affinityDiagram2.jpg) 

![analysing data digitally by using a word processor](images/analysisWord_copypaste.png)


After annotating your data you should take the decision in which media
you want to conduct your analysis: Digital in a word processor, where
lines hold the basic units of data, or analog on paper, where sticky
notes are your means of dealing with the data.

The analysis methods described here can be used in both media. Nevertheless, each
way has different strengths.

### Comparison  

The resources you need for the digital analysis in
a word processor is the word processor itself. An analogue analysis
needs sticky notes, paper, a printer (or a lot of patience to write all
by hand), (removable) tape and a big wall (2m\*3m minimum!). Usually the
wall is the showstopper here. But why should you want to use an analog
analysis if it needs all these resources? Partly, the decision can be
based on preferences: Some people like that they can move around the
notes by hand and can get an overview of their data by just stepping
back and glancing over it. 

If you work with peers on your analysis you have some advantages when using 
the analogue pen and paper approach: you can easily discuss your ideas with other 
 and will  get new ideas how to structure the data. 
 You could as well invite your boss to take a look and be part of the team, at least for some time. This type of on-site, collaborative, analysis is best done analogue. It is easy to move notes
around, and you can refer by pointing to data or just carry it over to someone and
ask for an interpretation. Using digital tools it is not that
easy and direct– despite of all the great digital tools we have nowadays.

### How-to

####  Analog

For working analog I recommend the following steps to get
analysis-ready:

1.  Create table in a word processor, many rows, 2 columns (given you
    print on DINA4) . Each table cell will be a note.
	1.  In the table settings, switch off page breaks in cells and
        switch »keep paragraphs together« on, so that one note/table
        cell will not break between pages.
	2.  In the table settings, choose a decent padding around each cell,
        like 0.5cm
	3.  Choose a font size of about 12pt, large enough to read it\
        ![](images/createAnalogNotes.png)
2.  copy/paste all your data (line by line) from the transcript into the
    cells
3.  print it
4.  cut out each table cell (=piece of data) 
5.  cover the wall with the paper from paper rolls (thus you can remove
    the analysis, roll up the paper and archive it and you could remove
    it from the wall temporarily)
6.  during analysis you will stick your printed notes on the widths of paper
    using removable tape, crepe tape or spray glue – something sticky
    but non-permanent, so you can move the notes around in order to gradually
    improve the structure.

####  word processor  

For working digital I suggest the following steps for preparing your analysis:

1.  Create a new document
2.  paste your transcript into that document
3.  Add a page break before the transcript to separate not-yet-grouped
    data from your (upcoming) structure of lines grouped by principles.
4.  During analysis you will create groups. Each group gets a headline.
    Create a hierarchy by using different paragraph styles – bigger
    headlines encompass smaller, lower in hierarchy headlines.
5.  Similar data is organized in lists. 
6.  To rearrange data you can use copy paste, drag and drop and the
     tools the word processor provides (toolbar to move points
    in lists etc.)
7.  If you use paragraph styles you can use the navigation tool of the
    wordprocessor to scan through your structure

## Develop a first Structure  {#firstStructure}

After you annotated your data you can start to structure the it.
Structuring the data means suggesting principles behind the data, naming
these principles and decide which data falls under which principle.

You don't use all your data yet. Start with what you find useful when
skimming through it or use just the data of two participants for now.
The goal is to set up some preliminary structure, like a scaffold.


![setting up a basic structure](images/lego_housefirstStructure.jpg)

### Move in Approximation

The easiest way to start a structure is moving similar data in
approximation. If you do you anaysis on paper,  cluster notes you
assume to follow a common principle in one place and notes for other
principles in other places. If you analyze using a wordprocessor, move similar 
notes in adjacent lines. Create different groups, each containing similar notes,
by using several line breaks above and below such a group or by 
creating a list for each assumed group or principle.

<div class="example">

- Asking herself: what would impress the person (a safety advisor)
 »probably not that the blueprint is beautiful«
- Good: Something that is not only useful, but aesthetical as well

*These Principles have in common that they are about aesthetics
and requirements. I did not have a good idea about a possible
group title or even a principle, so I just moved them in
approximation.*

</div>

<div class="gallery two">

![two (preliminary) groups as lines (the digital way)](images/abstractGroupLines.svg) 

![two (preliminary) groups as sticky notes (the analog way)](images/abstractGroupPapers.svg) 

</div>


### Name Commonalities  

You may have some data you assume to encompass a common principle but
you don't know the principle yet. But you have a vague feeling that it
may be connected to something. In this case just give that group of data a
preliminary title. A group name, even if it is not a principle, will
make dealing with the data easier since it gives your data some structure. 

As you gather other data that falls under that (yet
vague) category you may get an idea of how to state the principle in a
better way.

<div class="example">

- Inspiration
	-  I try to get new ideas by looking at google images
	-  While showering I get new ideas
	-  […]

-  Media
	- I like to use photos
	- The website is a great way to reach out

*These are mere titles, naming a commonality of the underlying
data but telling nothing useful for design (yet)*

</div>


### Name principles  

You may have read through your annotations and have noticed something
that may make a good principle right away. Great. Just write it down and
assign the data to it. Even if you have only one or two pieces
of data that fit the principle, don't worry, just see if the principle
will emerge to be bigger. If not, you can still revise the principle or
just get rid of it and see where else the data might fit.


<div class="example">

My first found principles were these:

-   Review previous projects
-   Test designs in the media you deliver in

\
\

The structure of my analysis looked like that (the main list points are titles of groups-of-groups,
the indented sub-lists are group titles):

-   Inspiration
	-   Review previous projects
	-   Other (Web, Bookstore)

-   Media
	-   Do tests in the media you target
	-   Suitablility of media
	-   »being closer« : 2 page spreads instead of single pages etc.
-   Idea Attachment
-   Motivation at the beginning; then the problems start.
-   Finishing is good
-   (Page) Format is hard to change later
-   TrialAndError
-   Mutual dependencies of design elements like type area, content, font size etc. (?)

Note that some are actual, meaningful principles (»Finishing is
good«, »(Page) Format is hard to change later«), while some are
mere group titles based on commonalities of the  data they encompass (»Inspiration«, »Trial and Error«).

</div>

## Fill the Structure  
When you came up with some principles and ideas to structure your data
you need to see if the structure is feasible. Go through your data and
sort it into the principles you can up with, or just move the data into proximity to
similar data.

The difference to the previous step is that we now focus on involving
all the data into the process of generating principles. In contrast, 
in the previous steps we focused more on generating a structure. 

If the previous step was building a (data-based) scaffold, now we try to build the actual walls.

![Build upon your preliminary structure to see if the idea actually works](images/lego_houseWalls.jpg)

Aim for 3 to 10 pieces of data per group. While
it is temporarily o.k. to have very small groups, at the end each
principle should be derived from several data points and not on a single
utterance. On the other hand if a principle encompasses more than 10
utterances or observations, think if creating two aspects or
»subprinciples« would make sense.

Usually I would go chronologically through all my notes starting with
the first participant and ending with the most recent one – though any
other scheme will suffice as well. Just be sure that you know with which data you
dealt with already and with which you did not.

When filling the data in the structure you may notice that you 
need additional groups and principles; some principles may need
to be renamed as well. Just go ahead and make these changes if you feel they are
needed.

<div class="example">


- \[Title:\] Test in the media you target
	-   I folded prototypes for paper sizes that seem to be suitable
	-   This is close the print shops results without spending too much
	-   Tedious: Not having an own printer
	-   […]

- \[Title\]»being closer«: Page Spreads instead of single pages
	- Creates page spreads (In books you have always 2 opposite pages, thus single pages are not useful for design)

 \

 Actually the example above is  is not great in terms of analysis: 
 The »Test in the Media you target«  data is almost all from one 
 person (P3) and the »being closer«-Group
 has only a single data point. In later iterations I'll change this
 group. But for now it suffices.

\
\

 While I was sorting the data I created a new group to accommodate data
 related to changes in designs:

-   \[Titel:\]Changing and determining
	-   Determining: What do we have? What do we need? What do we want to avoid?
	-   Sketching, e.g. for »How can I divide the page for 7 days of the week?«
	-   »This is trial and error«

\
\

Some data could not be accommodated yet. So I created a misc
group, where I could offload the data for now and try to find a better
place later:

-   \[Titel:\]misc
	-   god: Shortcuts
	-   I need to ask the print shop what this design would cost
	-   bad: Doing the same steps over and over again.
	-   \[…many other points…\]

Inside the misc group some possibilities for future principles
emerged – for example the first (god: Shortcuts) and the third
point (»bad: doing the…« could be part of a newly formed
principle named »I want to avoid repetitive tasks«

</div>

## Revise the Structure  

After you went through your data and sorted it into principles, review
your work. You now may have a clearer view of what constitutes the
principles after you matched the data with them.

If you recently dealt with just a particular part of the analysis (like dealing
with two particular groups), your view might be
too narrow: Glance over the whole range of principles and clusters and
rediscover groups that might be a better fit for some data.

Have a look at structures that need improvement: Groups that have a title but don't form
an actual principle yet as well as data for which you did not find a
good place. This data might be helpful to create actual principles.

Take a critical look at the principles in relation to the data they
encompass: Is there a fit or did you fall prey to wishful thinking? 
Possibly there is actually only a weak match between the stated principle and the
data. In this case revise your structure.

![Some parts need to be revised and newly created](images/lego_houseRevise.jpg)


### Find better names  

Groups based on commonalities or vague similarity will hopefully evolve
into principles. To archive this, try to revise group titles: make them
more concise, clear and meaningful. Try to find an actual principle for a group if 
 a group of data is just named with a title based on mere commonalities of
the data in that group. This will almost certainly require moving some data between
groups as well in order to accommodate the data to the improved 
structure.

<div class="example"> 

For one group I used the title »Arranging«, since arranging and aligning
 objects, lines and text to a predefined grid or to each other was a
 task that reoccured frequently. But the title  »Arranging« just names a
 commonality. To make clear that the group is
 about a user activity and to create a meaningful principle I
 renamed »Arranging« to »Arranging objects is an important activity«

</div>


<div class="example">

I had a group titled »repetitive and manually«. This could be easily
 renamed into a meaningful principle: »repetitive and ›do-it-manually‹
 tasks are tedious«. By just adding the users view (»are tedious«) the
 title became a useful principle for design. 

</div>

\
\

<div class="example">

I had the following structure:

-   Inspiration
	-   Review previous projects
	-   Others (Web, Bookshop)

 »Inspiration« was not a principle so I had a look at
 the underlying data. They all were about inspiration – but they
 had another commonality: All inspiration techniques used
 other, existing designs, often ones that were created by the
 same person or even for the same project (It would have been
 possible that people take a walk or have frequent brainstormings or take drugs to get new
 ideas etc.). So I renamed it and created the principle: »I use
 existing designs for inspiration«

</div>


### (re) move data to other groups  

When improving your structure it might be necessary to remove pieces of data from
groups, either moving to to a temporary »misc« group or to another, more suitable
group.

While we want to make use of the data we have, it is most
important to create sound and helpful principles based on the data – 
instead of just  putting everything under a label. 

It is possible that you can make a principle to be stated more clearly but in result, the  clearer title 
may no longer encompass all data in the group. In this case, go for clarity of principle, even if it means that the principle does not encompass all the data currently subsumed in the group. 

Take out the data that does not fit the improved title and see if it might
fit better to another group. If not, place it in a »not yet grouped« or
»misc«-Group. Revise that »misc« group when you made changes to your system and
see if you can use the data from that group to enhance other
groups with that data.

<div class="example">

I reviewed the following group:

-   Feedback
	-   good: getting feedback
	-   bad: uncertainty before feedback from client

\
The title was not a meaningful principle and I felt that the
analysis might benefit if I use the data in other groupings
and principles. I already had a cluster related to motivations
and emotions– where I moved *»bad: uncertainty before feedback
from client«*. The *»good: getting feedback«* was moved to a
cluster named *»Exchange with others«*. 

While I think I gained something out of it, these changes 
did not result in a new much better structure but was 
part of trials and errors in the process.
</div>


<div class="example">

Going through the data of a group named »general requirements« I noted
that a big part of the data was concerned with balancing  
*functional* or *practical* requirements (price, readability etc.) with
requirements concerning *style* (using colors, being innovative)

Thus I renamed the group to »trying to combine aesthetics and
functionality«. As the new title was more specific some data needed to
be taken out, put into other groups or to the temporary »misc« group.

</div>


<div class="example">

The previous examples were concerned with whole principles and groups
and thus focused on the macro level. Sometimes you just move data
itself, without any trigger like renaming, just because
you found a better fit. For example *»using the maximum possible height
on a sheet of paper«* was grouped into »media«. Later, I moved it to *»budget«*
because budget is something the user is directly concerned with,
whereas media is even more abstract. The group *»budget«* was then later
renamed *»having little money and resources«*, expressing that a part of
the participants work was finding out how they could make the most out
of a small budget (*»using the maximum possible height on a sheet of
paper«* is a practice that results from that concern.)

</div>

### Create Subgroups  

Some groups may grow rather big, especially if they are not actual
principles but based on mere commonalities of underlying data (like
»dealing with color«). This is an excellent opportunity to create
principles by creating subgroups. The process of developing subgroups
is like in  [»Develop a first structure«](#firstStructure) (just inside the group): Move
similar data in proximity and try to create clear-cut principles if
possible. In this process you might find a more suitable way to state
the principle of the main group as well.

<div class="example">

I had a group with more than ten points regarding »Collegues and
Friends«. This title was rather general and thus not very useful for
design. I created two subgroups which were more meaningful.

\
Before:

- Collegues, Friends etc.
	-   A friend told her that concrete is visualized dashed
	-   Puts sketches on the wall: Others will see it and talk with me.
	-   Which design do we take? Talks with fellow designer
	-   […]

after splitting and rearrangement:

-   Exchange Knowledge
	-   A friend told her that concrete is visualized dashed
	-   Puts sketches on the wall: Others will see it and talk with me.
	-   […]
-   making decisions with others
	-   Which design do we take? Talks with fellow designer
	-   feedback-rounds with other designers

</div>


<div class="example">

One main point in my first structure was »Highly motivated at the
beginning; then the problems start.«. After restructuring this became
a sub point of motivation related groups.

- \[group-of-groups\] Motivations
	-   \[Subgroup\]: Highly motivated at the beginning; then the problems start.
	-   \[Subgroup\]: Finishing is good
	-   \[Subgroup\]: Waiting for feedback is bad
	-   \[Subgroup\]: being afraid of clients rejection of the design
 
</div>

<div class="example"> 
\

sometimes you first sort the data under the overarching title or principle
and than move it to an already existing subgroup later:

The utterance: »Its bad that you can do imprecise things here,
compared to programming (talking about Illustrator)« was first sorted
into »Media« and subsequently put into »using the right media«

</div>

## Wrap it up  


![it’s done! (though you could still change some things or two…)](images/lego_houseFinished.jpg)

The steps above do build on each other. But like in other creative
tasks there will be a lot of going back and forth between steps of
creating groups, assigning data to them and revising these groups.

These iterations may also happen in parts of the structure you create.
 For example, after you revised your overall structure, you find that a grouping
should undergo a major change and you put all its data out. Then you are
back to developing a structure for a part of your analysis. Or you
notice that some notes that you moved in proximity can be summarized by
a clear principle, and you jump straight to the revision of that part of
the analysis, leaving the »fill in the data« step out. 

This process can take up some time. The analysis may never come to an
actual halt, but it will slow down at some point. Continuing to move
data may still do minor improvements but there are no big changes
anymore. Review the data a last time. The analysis is finished and it is
time to communicate your results.

<div class="example">

**Final structure:**

-   Arranging Objects as important part of the work 
-   using existing work for inspiration 
	-   review previous projects 
	-   use other’s work  
	-   use previous ideas from same project 
-   Media
	-   Test design in the target media 
	-   Find suitable media 
-   Being attached to ones own ideas         
-   Working visually 
-   Social 
	-   Exchange Knowledge 
	-   Collaborative decision making 
-   Motivation 
	-   Highly motivated at the beginning; then the problems start 
	-   Finishing is good
	-   Waiting for feedback is bad 
	-   being afraid of clients rejection of the design 
-   repetitive and manual work (negative)  
-   changes and requirements 
	-   Some changes like page format are hard to change later 
	-   combine function and aesthetics 
	-   changes cause other changes 
	-   considering the budget 
	-   trial and error as method 
	-   use the actual content for testing (not fake content) 
	-   fixate things to have a starting point 
-   Misc 
	-   designer vs. technology 
	-   making calculations 
	-   chosing fonts 

 
These are all the groups I created in my analysis. The results could be
more concise, having fewer groups concentrating on fewer themes. However
this would probably lead to more abstract principles which would
presumably harder to use in design.

The groups of groups are partly not principles themselves. I tried to
find some, but was not able in a part of the cases: »changes and
requirements« is not a useful design principle (but it’s subordinated
groups are: »combining functions and aesthetics« etc.). In contrast,
»using existing works for inspiration« is a group of groups which states
a meaningful principle.

You see that I could not use all data, so I made some less significant
groups in the “misc” section.

</div>

# Communicate Results 

<!-- TODO jan bis hier -->

If you work with others, the results of your research need
to be communicated.

Aside from getting the results of your research across, communicating
your results has some positive side effects: collecting, organizing and
summarizing your findings will make it easier for yourself to remember
your findings and you may be even able to improve your analysis further.

Keep in mind that the »right« way of communicating research results is
highly dependent on several factors: The skills and knowledge of the
audience, the goals of the project in general (the research in
particular) and the kind of reports your audience is used to.

So what I describe here can only be seen as a general introduction: I
try not to focus on particular forms of deliverables but show you the
elements you can combine in different media to communicate your results.

## Getting it across

It can be hard to make an impact with your research: If it is not clear why the results of your research matter they are easily dismissed 

Probably the best form to communicate your research is to do the
research (at least partly) with others. Those who do the research with
you will know first-hand how it was done and what the results were. In
addition, they will probably identify themselves with the research and
its outcomes and might support your cause.

However, this is not always possible and you may need to resort to a
less interactive, more typical form of communication – like writing
reports and making presentations. When you communicate your results in
this way, keep in mind that reports and slides may easily end up as
»dead documents« – informations which are available but are not used.

To make this less likely to happen, find out what the interests of the
document’s audience are and how you can communicate with them to get
their attention.  

## Who is your audience? 

Consider the audience’s needs when communicating.  If
you want a programmer to understand you, you might highlight different
aspects and use different words compared to presenting the results to
your professor or boss. Think about what matters for those who should
listen to you and structure your information accordingly: If your
professor cares about novel ways of interaction, highlight aspects that
might help when developing them; if some people you work with think that
»users don’t get it«, emphasize the reasons for the behavior of the
people you studied.

Keep in mind that the jargon that might be used by others has its own
rules. Only use words and concepts that will be understood by your
audience and which you know yourself – don’t fake it.

## Explain your Research 

You should not only communicate your results but as well how you got to
them. This permits others to evaluate your reserach in the context of the
explained methods and enables you to show that you arrived at your
results using an empirical and structured approach.

### Explain your Methods 

Explain the research methods you used to arrive at your results. This
includes:

-   Selection of participants (sampling) 
-   Data gathering 
-   Data analyis 


<div class="example">

I recruited the participants by asking on mailing lists, bulletin boards
and in facebook groups. The request was like this:

“We, a team of students of the Weimar University, want to improve the
free layout program frame drawer and want the application to match your
workflow and needs. Therefore we would like to gather some insights in
the way you work.

If you would like to support us, someone from our team would visit your
workplace and ask you some questions and look over your shoulder while
you work. This would take approximately 1h.

All participants get a \$10 voucher for the university's cafeteria. If
you would like to participate (or have further questions) please write a
mail to jan.dittrich@example.com”

(Data gathering)

We gathered the data by asking open questions in a semi-structured
interviews. In addition, we observed the research participants doing
their work. The participants were invited to just continue to work on
what they would have done when we would not have been there.

The data gathering was done by single researchers, though one session
was done by two team members together (one taking notes, the other
asking the questions)

We recorded the data by doing an audio recording of questions and
answers in addition to handwritten notes. We photographed and sketched participants
during key activities and made photos and sketches of tools important to
their work.

(Analysis)

After the research sessions we gathered all notes and supplemented
forgotten or unclear data by using the audio recordings and sketches. We
annotated all data for possible meanings and interrelations to create a
preliminary scheme for organizing the data into meaningful principles.
This patterns served as a starting point for organizing and reordering
the data during several iterations. Thus, the process was similar to
affinity diagramming (Beyer, Holtzblatt) or Thematic Analysis (Virginia,
Clarke)

</div>

### Site and Sample 

To make your research less abstract for the audience, give an
introduction to the environment you did the research in. Describe it in
a way that allows others to imagine it, for example by showing sketches, 
photos of tools or the participant’s workplace. Remember to show only
what the participants agreed to share with you and the audience.

In addition to the context, describe your research participants by
giving a general user profile. Thus you don’t share any personal data of
anyone but allow your audience to have some ideas of the participants.

<div class="example">

Participants were students (four of them) or recent graduates (one of
them).  All had studied several terms already and had work experiences
from at least one internship. Four were female, one were male.

All participants were asked to meet with us at the place where they
usually work. Partly this was in their flats; We met one participant in
a shared working space and one remotely via telephone and screensharing.

## Components of deliverables and reports


Let me give a brief overview of typical building blocks for
communicating your research. They are all useful on their own and you
can combine them to use their strengths together.

### Text 

Text is as very versatile way to convey informations. On the downside,
text may seem not as quickly accessible as a diagram or a sketch. To
lower the barriers, make sure that people know why they are reading
your text. Give essential information at the beginning (What is this
text about? Why was the work done?) and make sure that it is easy to get
a quick overview:  Structure your text using headings, lists and
italics to guide the reader.

![a page spead from a report](images/exampleWrittenReport.png)


There are lots of books which explain how to write concise and
easy-to-get text. The most efficient guide I know was given by George
Orwells in »Politics and the English Language« – I quote:


<blockquote>

1. Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you
 are used to seeing in print.
 
2. Never use a long word where a short one will do. 

3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.

4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.  

5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if
    you can think of an everyday English equivalent.  

6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything barbarous.

</blockquote>
^[Orwells Rules for writers:
[http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/Politics\_and\_the\_English\_Language](http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/Politics_and_the_English_Language)]

In addition, read the text aloud – in particular, if you already noticed
that you have had difficulties finding the right word or to express a
complicated concept. If you need to re-read sentences to make sense of
them or to stress the right words, you should go for a rewrite.

### Quotes

Quotes convey the participant’s motivations and feelings. This is
important to help others to have empathy with the users.

<div class="example">
**Rather abstract:** Users like the alignment function

**Combined with Quote**: Users like the alignment function. Sandy: »It is
like doing work by magic – click! And its there!«
</div>

Remember to protect the participant's identity if they did not give you
the permission to share their quotes or names. If they did not give you
the permission, only share a plausible, but faked »quote« and don't use
real names but faked ones as well. Don’t deceive your audience either:
mention that the names and quotes are not real but are only
corresponding to their actual counterparts.

### Scenarios

Activities don’t happen in isolation from each other: They depend on
previous activities and (possible changing) motivations. One way to
communicate a sequence of interrelated activities is a scenario. Simply
put, a scenario is a short story written as text or given as a sequence
of images (like a comic)

A good framework for writing scenarios is asking yourself these
questions:

-   **Person**: Who is the main person in the scenario? 
-   **Motivations**: Why does this person what he/she does? What is the
    motivation? 
-   **Activities**: What are the actions of the person and how are they
    done?  
-    **Context**: Where and When does the scenario take place?  

Answer them in your scenario.

<div class="example">

Annika studies media culture and needs to finish here homework
on »Cultural subconceptualist theory in the works of Koons« in order to
hand the homework in on time. She goes to the library to see if the book
on »Capitalism in the works of Rushdie« by Andreas Geoffrey contains
arguments supporting her view on the structuralist paradigm.

She enters the library and walks up to one of the computers standing in the corners of the library's halls.

She wants to look up the name of the author, but she notes that she
forgot the copy of the book that referenced the work. She still knows
that »Rusdie« or »Rushdie« was in the title of the book she needs. After
several trials she finds the right spelling of the name and, after
scanning through a list, she finds the book she wants to read. The
detail page of the search application gives the address of the library
building she is in already and a code: »X0-3R52«… \[scenario may continue\]

</div>



### Diagrams

Diagrams are useful to show high-level concepts, relations and
dependencies – for example showing which activities need to be done to
create a page of a magazine or the ways a group of students share files
when working together on a joint project.

### Photos and Illustrations

Which one is easier to understand and less ambiguous:

This: 

<div class="example">

The participant’s desk is rather tidy. In front of the keyboard is
a book and on the book a calculator. Left hand are additional utilities,
like…

</div>

Or that:

![](images/ObservationDesignU4Workplace.jpg)

I suppose the image wins.

While the above example just shows a setting, we could as well combine
the strengths of text and images in an annotated photo.

Or you could show your general findings about how people organize their
desktops by sketching a prototypical arrangement of items.

Illustrations and photos in particular have another function aside of
getting information across: They make the research and its findings more
graspable, intuitive and »real« for your audience. Just like scenarios
and quotes they enable to imagine how your research participants acted
which in turn helps to develop empathy for them. Consider again our
example from above in which an image and a text were compared. The photo
does not only give some abstract information. It shows that you have
been with actual participant or – in this case – did research on actual
tools they use.

When using photos, remember to protect the privacy of your participants.
Only show photos of their workplaces or of themselves if they agreed to
it.

## Typical Documents for reporting results (»Deliverables«)


You can combine text, images diagrams and scenarios in several ways to
communicate your message. Let’s look at some possibilities.

### Quick findings

Quick findings are short, annotated lists of your most important
findings. They include a brief description of methods, participants and
environment and usually a disclaimer that this is only a very brief
summary and that the  (preliminary) results may be refined later.

Quick findings are very useful if your audience :

-   already know about your research and want to have a look at your progress
-    have very little time, and need an efficient access to your  results

### Written Reports

Written reports are roughly four to a several dozen pages long.
Nevertheless, only deliver what the audience needs and wants to know –
be concise. It is easy to get sidetracked and to write length and
complex sentences.

Written reports consist mainly of text, but you should use images,
quotes and diagrams too when they make sense.

I suggest the following structure for your reports:

-   summary of the key facts and findings
-   Why: Research interest
-   How: Research methods
-   Who and Where: Describe participants and site 
-   Your findings 
-   Conclusions and suggestions 

![page spread from a report on wiki use for teaching at university](images/exampleWrittenReport2.png)


### Slides

Slides can deliver the same content as written reports or quick
findings. They convey the information in a more visual way – so they
have fewer text and more images, diagrams, and storyboards.

If you give the presentation yourself try to deliver as few as possible
of the information by text on the slides. You can do the talking and the
slides supplement the information you give. On the other side, it may
makes sense to use more text on the slides if you just share the slides
with others and don’t present them yourself.
