# Introduction

## Why I wrote this book

I think that products should not only be usable but also useful. This means they satisfy an actual need of the people using them. To be able to build such products, you need to find out about motivations, activities and problems of the (potential) product’s users.

<!--  I think my first project in that direction was a bookmark manager and my research consisted of asking some people these questions via mail:

> * What do you do when you find information on a webpage useful for you (Bookmarks, Scrapbook, Delicious, simply remember) and why?
> * What do you find difficult about the current system to refind informations on the web and why?

I got some interesting mails back and tried to consider their answers in my design. Looking back, I would have done a few things differently, but for a small project I think it was a good method. -->

<!-- Possible example here -->

It was initially not easy to learn about this: Some books started with a lot of theory that was build on additional theories. Other books were more design oriented, but seemed to require a big team of well-trained people and a huge budget. However, there were also great resources, blog posts and conversations that helped me to find methods that I could use for my projects. In this book I want to show you how to use these methods.

These methods should…

* … be useful for design projects in business and academia
* … work without a large budget
* … be understandable and applicable without a specific (academic) background

To ease learning, I provide examples. I found it particularly useful to have them myself when learning about skills like *asking open questions* or *clustering themes*. Much more useful than a definition is to see how these are done.

Friends supported me by volunteering for an example research project on the work of freelancing designers, so a lot of examples will be drawn from this project.

## User need research is most useful in early stages of a project

User needs should be researched in *early* project stages. It is less useful when a lot of time and money has been spent already on building a particular product.

Here are some scenarios in which user need research makes sense:

**1. There is a broad topic given, which you want to explore further.**

Starting with a broad topic, not focused on a particular implementation, gives a lot of freedom. Such projects are not very common, though.

> You should find out about people “using libraries” or even “Finding and working with information in media”.

**2. There is an idea for a product or a service**

You want to find out what user motivations, activities and problems are important to consider when building a product or service. This is the scenario in which I use user need research most often.

> The library wants to create an app for creating bibliographies.
> They want to find out what they need to consider when doing this

**3. An existent product is to be improved or changed.**

> The library already has an app for creating bibliographies since several years.
> But students complain about it being useless and hard to use.
> Now the library wants to find out how version 2.0 should be different

If an *existing* product should be improved, it is common to use usability tests. But it makes sense to combine tests with user need research—what about finding out about the usability problems of the current system by observing users’ everyday tasks?

<!-- align the team, ideas -->

## Our inquiry concerns the user, not our (future) product

You now may be very motivated to start designing your future product. But if you focus on the *product* now, your research findings will be tied that specific product—which may or may not be useful for your users. If you instead focus on the *user*, your findings will be independent of a particular product implementation.

This idea seems to be hard to grasp. When I talk about user need research, a frequent assumption is, that I ask users things like this:

* What do you want?
* How I should design a product for you?

However, I don't do this: It would not tell me much about the *how* and *why* of their actions—only that they want something.

Sometimes, user need research is also confused with usability testing. In usability testing, you test a product to improve it. Usability testing is not about finding user needs that exists independent of that product.

Paradoxically, we need to *let go* of our focus on *products* to be able to understand the users and to develop products that users need.


## User need research is an iterative process, not a linear one

The process that I describe in this book may seem to be divided into clear steps, each of which having its own chapter. But in contrast to what the linear structure of this book suggests, it is very useful to switch between steps and also go back to previous ones:

* If I talk to three students about eLearning (Step: *Data Gathering*), and two of them mention they use Facebook discussion groups for exchanging on learning tasks with peers, I could specifically recruit additional people (Back to step *Prepare your research*) who could walk me through a few of such groups.
* If I notice in *data analysis*, that I can't make much sense of the emerging themes, I could schedule a few sessions of listening and observing and focus on the topics of motivation, freedom and client feedback (and by that go back to *prepare research*, *data gathering* and *analyzing data*).

User need research is an iterative process: Instead of doing all steps once after each other, you can loop some of them before proceeding. This allows using insights from later steps (like analysis) to shape earlier steps (like data gathering).
