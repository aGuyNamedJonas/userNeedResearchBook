# Data Gathering  

In this chapter we will learn how to gather data to get to know about the activities, motivations and problems of our research participants.
We will gather informations by listening to descriptions and explanations of our participants and by observing them working.
The resulting data will be text and images.

Contrary to a common misconception of user need research, our inquiry will not be (directly) about future ideas and design –
we are will not ask »do you think that a \[gadget\] would help you?«. It  is very hard to reliably guess if something would be a
great thing to have in the future and the answer would tell you not much about the actual activities, motivations or problems
of the participant. Instead of dealing with ideas directly we will find out about the how and why of our participant’s activities
and thus set a reliable foundation for our designs.

We see our participants as competent in what they do: they are experts in their fields and in their daily work.
Emphasizing the expertise of the participants is contrary to the idea of designers and programmers as people who improve the lives of those
who »don’t get it«.
Instead of this, we assume that the participants of our research have a reason of doing their work the way they do it.
We try to find out these reasons behind their activities.
Getting to know the »how« and »why« of the users actions will allow us to evaluate our ideas (does it match their ideas of good work?) and
to get inspiration for new ideas (how can we support this motivation?)

## Inform and ask for their Consent

When you have found a participant, a place, a time and have your equipment ready
we can start with the actual research session.

My  advice is  simple: Be friendly. If you come to
their place (which is preferable, since you can observe the actual
context) be a nice guest; if they come to your place or you meet in some
»neutral space«, be a nice host.

Greet the participant and thank for his/her time:

> Hello Lisa, great to meet you. I’m pleased, that you could free some time for showing and telling me how you work.

You may sprinkle in a bit of smalltalk:

> Did you have a good start into the day?

Participants should at least roughly know what the research is
about. You don't need to reveal all your questions and topics
 but the general topic should be described

>This research helps us to improve the workflow in the design process to design solutions for people who do graphic design.

Make clear that you are here to learn – and not an evaluator of the
quality of the participant’s work.

>…Therefore we'd like to get to know how you work. You are an expert in
 that field and we'd like to learn from you. This is not some kind of
 test – when I ask questions there are no wrong answers

Although you may have described the timeframe and the method already
when recruiting, tell the participant what you are going to do

> We will have a conversation about your work and I'll be asking some
questions. In addition, I’m interested in watching you when you do your work.
The whole process will take about an hour of time.


The participant must know how you record data and who will see it. So
tell the Participant:


> I'd like to take notes, and, in addition, record audio – if that is
ok with you. The audio recording helps me to focus on your work as I
don’t need to concentrate as much on writing notes, if I have the
recording as backup. Me and a colleague will listen to the audio;
we will anonymize and transcribe the data before we share
it with the product design team.
>
> If you feel uncomfortable with being recorded at any time we can pause
the recording.
>
> You can cancel the interview at any time if you feel it is needed.

I had rarely someone who did not agree to being recorded. If that
happens you can ask if they have any specific worries – possibly you can
inform them about that specific aspect and they might agree when they
have  additional information.


> [Example from an in-house research project] »Audio recording… I’m not sure about this…«
»Thats fine with me. Though, may I ask what worries are?« »Hmm…yeah, I don't like, you know, human
 resources to get that data«
>
>  »I understand your concern. It is fine if you don't agree but I can
 assure you that Human Resources is a separate section. We don't share
 personal data and what we record today is not accessible to them. Also, all data
 that leaves my computer or the one of my colleague is being anonymized
 and we remove all data that points to you as person, including names,
 workplace and so on.


If they don’t agree, just stick with writing notes.

Consider summarizing the information about the research and the use of
the participant's data in a consent form that the user signs. In this
case keep the signed form, but hand the participant a copy of the form.
Thus the agreement is clear for both sides. See in the Appendix for an
[example of such a form](#consentForm).

After you got the consent of the participant, you can start the research
session.


## Modes of gathering data  

### Getting answers  

<!-- Gathering information by listening to the participant’s answers is similar to  a
conversation: You ask questions, the user answered them. -->


We gather data by asking questions and listening to the participant’s answers.
However, the use of questions and answers in user needfinding is unlike the
questions and answers in questionnaires. In questionnaires it is often aimed for short, definitive
answers out of a determined set of possibilities (»on a 4 point scale: how much do you
agree with…«). Instead of this, we aim for longer answers that are not
from a determined set of possible answers. Thus we are more likely to get rich descriptions,
much like veritable stories which retell the participant’s experiences. In addition, these
 stories  tell us about the context of the user’s activities and the user’s motivations.
 To encourage giving such story like answers,  we will often ask for *descriptions*
 of activities and the *reasons* for doing them.

> »Can you describe me how you decided to use this layout?«
>
> »You said that you need to look that color model up. Why?«

Asking questions and getting answers form a participant is a very versatile
tool. It can be done without many resources. You are not tied to a specific place and
you can talk about past events as well as future plans.

But because of this it can happen that you hardly focus on actual occurrences and
experiences. Observations are thus a good supplement to asking questions and listening, since
observations are naturally concerned with actual actions you can see happening at the very moment.

### Observation  

What Participants describe is not always the ideal way to convey the
information. Just like a picture can be worth a thousand words, it makes
often sense to just ask participants to show what they mean and to demonstrate
how they work.

Often it is easier for a research participant to just do what they do
anyway instead of verbalizing it. It generates more information for you as
well. It is more vivid, and the potentially distorting step of translating a
process into a description is no longer required. When you observe, you
will even notice things your participants would never consider
mentioning: It may have become second nature for them which tools they use,
how they apply these tools to their work and which problems they meet.
As well, you may gain information about the context, like means of communicating
with co-workers or cues in the environment that point out problems
 – for example quick fixes with tape, or added instructions on devices and machines.

It is not needed to have observation as a separate step in the research process.
It makes great sense to interweave it with asking questions and listening to the user.
Instead asking for descriptions of processes or tool, you can ask for a demonstration.

> Participant: »So I got this image and now I would try to get a
suitable crop for that flyer«
>
> Researcher: »Can you show me how you do it?«

Think of yourself as an apprentice of the participant. The participant
is the master or expert who can teach you some of his/her skills.
This means that understanding the user by observing is not a passive process.
Like an apprentice, you can and should ask questions.


> Ask about reasons: »You drew that object and changed it size, then you
deleted it again… what was the reason behind this?
>
> Ask about things you notice in the environment: »Can you tell me what
these markings are for?«

Teaching an apprentice is not a theoretical or artificially set up
process:

> The tasks you observe should be tasks the participant is actually doing
(and not something set up for you):
>
> Participant: »What should I do now?«
>
> You: »What would you do if I would not be here?«
>
> Naturally they should be relevant to your interests as well:
>
> [continuing the conversation above] Participant: »I would either crop this bunch of images
 or I'd try to find a suitable font for the headlines in this document
>
> You: »If the tasks are equally relevant to you I'd be more interested in watching you
choosing the fonts«

Avoid positioning yourself as the expert in the participant’s domain by suggesting
 procedures and by telling the participant  how and why something should be done.
If the participant would just look up to you and your concept of how work should be
 done we would not get to know anything.

## Building trust

In this section I demonstrate how you can show that you value the
participant’s time and input and make the participant  feel comfortable during the research.  

User researchers ask lots of possibly awkward feeling questions and at
least in the beginning, a research session could be unusual for some
participants. In this section we are going to look at some ways to
ensure that the research session will be a pleasant experience.

### Start with simple questions  

Start simple with some demographical questions  – like: *»Lets start with
some simple questions about your job«*. You can ask *»What is your job
title«* and maybe follow *»How do you name your Job when friends ask you
what you do?«.* As well it might be interesting how experienced the
person is: *»How long have you been working in your current
occupation?«* These examples are tied to work related studies – for
doing research on university students I tie the questions to their
particular context and ask for example how long they have been studying
so far.

A very obvious advantage of these questions is that they will help you
to get to know some context of the participant’s work. But there is
another advantage: Such questions – like asking for the job title or years in the job
 etc. – are easy  to answer. This gets the participants used to answering
 questions and opening up towards you. After a brief section with these
 easy-to-answer questions you can  transition into more open questions.

### Affirm that you listen  

You will ask questions aiming for descriptions and longer answers. So
you will be listening to the participant most of the time.
You probably have some ways to intuitively show that you listen
 – like nodding with the head or saying »yes« or »mm-mhh«.
 This is an important way to ensure the participant that his/her information
 is listened to and valued.

However, when giving this kind of feedback you should be careful though
not to skew the answers by indicating that some information is better
than other. If you throw in a »yes, great« combined with nodding (as if you
prefer what the participant did in comparison to something else) or if you
just make a rather unmotivated »mm« and frown (as if what is
told does not match your expectations) the participant will get
selective about his/her answers and focus on stuff you seem to like. Try
to keep the reassuring sounds or gestures neutral towards the
information you get.

Same goes for longer intersections at the end of an
answer. Intuitively you may say:

> »It was great to hear that you exchange files by mail!« (Since you may
have already thought of a feature that might be helpful in that case)

But the participant will try to be a nice person him/herself and
probably try to make you happy by going on about the problems with files
in mails even though sending files per mail is possibly not that bad in the participant’s view.
Instead of  reassuring the participant using  judgements and emotions, focus on the
fact that you got information you that helps you:

> »That was interesting to hear –«

Possibly you could even wrap the information up »So you…« and/or refer
to an area you like further information about. So it will be clear
that you care for the information and listened well – without casting
some judgement on what was told to you.

### Body Language  

![not-so-good posture](images/bodyPostureBad.jpg){.portrait}

![much better posture](images/bodyPostureGood.jpg){.portrait}

Make a friendly impression by using body language. Probably you would not
make a bad impression anyway, but let’s go through it nevertheless:
Don't give an angry or stern impression by frowning and crossing arms
and legs. Don't look careless by leaning back and looking to the
ceiling. During the interview, show reactions to what the participants says or does  and look him/her
in the eyes (at least for members of western culture). When taking notes,
maintaining eye contact is not possible all the time – but keep eye contact when you can.

### Just ask  

Even if you got the consent to audio record and make photos or
video ask, before you start the recording.


> »I'd start the recording, if that’s o.k.« (go ahead if there are no
 objections)
>
> »May I take a picture?«

Usually I fade out the length of  these questions once the participant agreed,
so the next time I'm photographing and I see no obvious obstacles (an
obstacle might be a blueprint for a project under construction on screen
or desk or anything else that is more confidential than what one would
usually expect), I go with »May I…« the next time and fade out asking
each time. Ask not only for recording activities – it goes for all other
activities of yours you feel unsure about: just ask. By that, you show
respect and care for the participant and you avoid awkward
situations.

## Asking open questions  

You may have noticed that the suggested questions from the previous
section are not aiming for specific, short answers.
In situations different from user need research  you often  want answers to be
short and precise:  »Are you a graphic designer?« »I am a Graphic Designer!« /
»How much do you like your Job? Give a mark« »B!« / »Please name your Tools!«
»InDesign, Photoshop«.

If you would diagram who speaks for how long when we ask for specific
information with a »closed« range of possibilities, it would
look like this:

![short closed questions](images/talkDiagram_closed.svg)

These questions demand very specific answers from a determined
set: Yes or no, marks from A-F, a list of nouns. They would be useful if
you would want to do statistics, for analysis that allows us to give results
like »56.3% agreed strongly on Question X«. However, we want to find out
about the *why* and *how* of the participant’s work here ^[Research  concerned
with finding out about »how« and »why« using methods like interviews and
observations is also called »qualitative« research. In contrast, »quantitative research«
usually tests hypothesis (like »an orange ›buy‹ button generates more
sales that a blue one «) and employs controlled experiments and statistics. In this book
we learn about qualitative methods].

Imagine, in contrast to the research session outlined above (short
answers, short questions) a day-to-day situation, in which you get to
know about somebody else’s experiences: A conversation with a friend. In
such an exchange you will tell each other about your experiences, what you
felt, why you did this and that etc. In a diagram it would look like
this:

![giving longer answers, equal share](images/talkDiagram_friend.svg)

In contrast to a conversation, our main goal is to collect data; we
don’t want to tell about our Job as a user researcher, but
mostly hear answers from the participant. Thus asking questions and
getting answers in a user needs research session look like this:

![participant gives long answers, researcher asks short, open questions](images/talkDiagram_open.svg)


The questions we want to ask should encourage answers which describe
experiences and give some insight into the »why« and »how« of the users
activities and motivations. This type of question is called »open
question« since these questions don’t have a determined (»closed«) set of answers.


> Open questions would be: *»Describe how you started your work today«*
or *»Why did you copy that page?«*

Using such open questions encourage telling longer, story-like
answers. These answers will even contain information you did not expect
to get.


> A participant is describing me the printing process: *»…then I look up
 which color specification the print shop needs…«*
>
>That is a new step in the workflow I did not expect (Naively, I thought that you just send
the document to the print shop like you would when you print it on your desktop printer –
have a file, print it).
>
> Thus, I discovered a step in the workflow and a potential field of work (taking care of color spaces and profiles) of which I did not know that it even exists!

The information you get will not be abstract as in answers like »good«
or »I dislike it« but tied to a situation. This is preferable, because a
future product will be used in real situations and not in an abstract
space of thought.

> »I like it when the feedback [to the design] comes quickly. No annoying
waiting… it always makes me nervous. Do they [the client] like it or
do I need to throw out work?«
>
> – this tells us more about the situation
than a client’s feedback being just described as »good«.

If you look back to the questions already mentioned, they will share some
characteristics.

> Here are some possible questions
>
> -   Can you describe the worst experience in your day so far?
> -   Can you tell me how you create a layout?
> -   Can you tell me what makes a client »difficult«
> -   Can you describe how do you get new ideas?


All these questions start with »…can you describe« or »…can you tell me«, which
encourages a longer answer (since »describing« or »telling« demands more than one word).
In addition, all sentences contain a *Why-*, *What-* or *How-*. These
question words, again, suggest an elaborate answer, not just one
or two words.

Thus, a template for such questions would look like *»Please tell me [how/why/what] +
[your interest]«*

Contrast this with questions like

> You: »Is this a good design?«
>
> Participant: »yes!«

»Is…« -questions will be answered with »yes« or »no« – but we don't get to know why the participant to approves or disapproves. In addition, »Is…«-Questions are a subtle form or influence ^[Also called a »leading question«] : In case of doubt it is  likely that are participant just agrees to the suggestion you give by asking »Is…«

Sometimes,  »Is«-Questions will  come in a disguised
form – as an addition which is made to an open question:

> You: »Can you tell me how you solve this problem? *…Do you do it by just
 calling the client and resolving the issue?*«
>
> Participant: »Yes, I do«
>
> Please note that the question did not contain the word »is«, but follows the same pattern of
 asking for a binary »yes« or »no« response.

Avoiding closed questions is actually harder than one thinks. We intuitively try
to make answering easier with such additions like »Do you […]«.

When you create your questions check if they demand some predetermined
outcomes – if they do, they are closed questions. In this case reformulate the questions in a way
that allows non-restricted, story-like answers.

## Overcoming problems  

There are some problems that are likely to arise when you gather data.
Knowing the problems and some ways of dealing with them will help you.

### Be aware of your influence

A very obvious problem is influencing the participant. One way to minimize this would be
making all research sessions alike – just like you would do when using a
standardized questionnaire. But doing this you would loose the very strengths of the methods
described here: Being able to find out about new and unexpected things and reacting to them
and gaining some understanding of the »how« and »why« by asking questions and looking
for cues depending on the situation.

Each participant and his/her context is different and you can accommodate this by
adjusting the research session to the context and the activities of the user.
This would not be possible when asking the same questions each time.

So you neither can’t nor should take yourself out of the research session – you will always have some sort of effect on the participant when you do the research.

What you should avoid though is influencing the participant by
»suggesting« favorable answers or actions. Some sorts of this type of  influence are obvious,
others are not.

> »This is good, isn’t it?!«

Is a very obvious influence, since it blatantly states what you
think the answer should be: A »yes«.

There are less obvious influences as well:

> »Would you like a better version of this with a big button here?«

In this example, a positive word (»better«) and a suggestion go together. Who would
not like an improvement?! A »yes« is guaranteed – as well as a meaningless
finding which would be »people want improvements«.

Aside from your questions you could influence the user with your
feedback since it might suggest that there are »good« and »bad« answers.
For example, it may be tempting to correct users and show the »right
way« of doing something:


> If you know that there is a »change color« function in the application
and the user says: »Well; I am annoyed by that application – I'd like
to change the colors but they are fixed!« It may be tempting to
say: »No, you can change it!«


Remember that you want to find out what your participant does and why. To
correct the participant is not very useful.  Use the possibility to further explore the topic
without correcting the user ^[If, however, the participant would
clearly benefit from knowing some technical detail, just give the crucial information after the session] .


> You can just ask »what's the reason for you doing it this way«, or,
if talking about the function itself is really  important to you, you can
ask »How did you expect to do the color change if there would be such a function?«

Similarly, you could be surprised or even annoyed by steps or actions
in a workflow of the user which seem outright superfluous.

> »When I write a text I write a draft and then send it to my colleague
via mail as an attached .doc file. My colleague comments on it and
returns the mail to me«
>
>You may think that this is rather inefficient.
You may be tempted to say »Why don't you paste the text in the mail
and comment directly? Or write it live on Etherpad? This would be far
quicker!«

Remember that nobody does inefficient things by purpose. Assume that the
user has a reason. Try to find out what this reason may be.

> Again you could ask: »what's the reason for you doing it this way«
– and remember to ask follow-up questions to further explore
the issue.

Your influencing feedback could be non-verbal as well. Like in everyday
conversations, you may shrug or frown if you disagree with an
utterance or an action. Even if you don’t say »this is wrong«, frowning
or shaking your head may have the same results.

So: don’t be afraid to react towards the participant – reacting towards the participant is
essential in our research. But don’t suggest »good« or »bad« answers or
»good« or »bad« ways of doing things by using words, gestures or facial expressions.

### Silence feels strange but is o.k.  

Sometimes, the participant will take time to think before answering.
Intuitively, you may want to fill the silence to help the participant
along.

> »Can you describe me what happened after you were finished with
creating the print-ready-file? [1 sec] Was it all well?« »yeah, sort
of well I think«


It is tempting to fill the silence with suggestions for the answer. But
it can skew the answers and can turn a open question (»can you
describe…?«) into a closed question (»can you describe… was it…?«
/»yes«).

Try to tolerate the silence. Usually, the participant will
answer within a few seconds. If you notice silence which you want to fill, count
to 3 or 5 before probing further. When the set time is up, you can ask
about the question rather than giving suggestions, like


> What makes the question hard to answer?

Or

> Can you tell me what you are thinking about?


If the participant has started to give an answer already but stops talking and makes a longer pause and you still like to know more, you could »echo« the most recent statement or words the participant has said.



> Participant: »So I had it finished and send it away to the client and then almost nothing… [Pause]«
>
> Researcher: »almost nothing?«


This is a technique to make people carry on without skewing their
answer.


> Researcher:»almost nothing?«
>
> Participant: »Yes, there was a brief mail that they got the
 design but I was unsure if that person actually gave it to
 the people who can decide something. That waiting just sucks.«


### Keep your questions simple

Questions should be simple to understand and only one question should be asked at
once.

> Can you describe how you align these elements? What is good about the resulting design?

The question asks two things at once. This is has some disadvantages:

1.  It confuses the interviewee – what should be answered first?
2.  Both, Interviewer and Interviewee need to remember both questions while talking and listening

So, one question should be asked at once. In the example above one question
should be asked first, then the second:


> »Can you describe how you align these elements?« [Answer]
>
> »What is good about the resulting design? « [Answer]


### Don’t make the user the designer

It is tempting to skip investigating the »how« and »why« of the
participant’s work and to ask the participant directly  
how the final product should be like.

>  Which function do you need for aligning objects?
>
> Yes, there should be a button for, like equal distributions… here.
It should be easy, so it should have a button with a ›distr‹ on it in
red, so I don’t overlook it…

A variation of it is asking if a design you suggest should be used:

> Would a function for choosing a color scheme help you?

Asking the user for a design sounds like a reasonable thing to do – the resulting
designs would be directly based on the suggestions of the participant.

But it usually leads to bad design results: Even for experienced designers it may be hard to come up with a good interface which is easy to learn and efficient to use. And even experienced designers take time, often creating multiple versions which are then tested. How should somebody inexperienced in that task come up with a great interface spontaneously?

<!-- could be more crisp and slightly more extensive: --> 
Asking the user for a design also makes your research less useful. You will get to know that a participant thinks a particular design would be useful. But you don't get to know about the »how« and »why« of the user’s work. 

If you *really* want to discuss a design suggestion, use it to find out more about the »how« and »why« of the user’s work and tie it to a specific situation. 

> *[Design Suggestion:]* We think of a system in which colors can be changed like you just
changed the paragraph-styles. *[Encouraging to tell more about the activity:]* How would such a feature be relevant or not *[Specific situation:]* in the task you just described?

Thus, you can get more information on the *tasks* for which the feature could be
useful. The question is not concerning a vague, general future use but to a specific  one.

\

Asking the user for design ideas is tempting but rarely useful. If possible, avoid it and concentrate on the finding about how and why they work the way they do. 

## Referring back  

In this section I will demonstrate how to maintain flow and elicit
further information by referring to previous answers or demonstrations.  

### Referring back  for further elaboration

![Continue with same topic by referring back to something just said](images/talkDiagram_ReferBackDirect.svg)

A typical use of that method is asking for further information on
something that was mentioned and which interests you in particular.
In this case, refer back to the information and ask for elaboration.

Here are some examples:

> That typography settings – you said they are far more precise than the
ones in word processors. Can you explain me how these differences help you to
design compared to the ones in word processors?

or

> You said that you would continue with setting up the ›masterpage‹. Can you show me how?

![change the topic by referring to something said some time ago](images/talkDiagram_ReferBackDistance.svg)

You can refer back to the answer which was just given and
continue with the same topic. But referring back can be used as well to provide a transition between
*different* topics. This is especially useful if the participant is
talking about something that deviates much from what you are interested
in. By referring to something previously mentioned or demonstrated you can show
that you have been attentive and thus make the topic change less
intrusive:


> »…so this was a design made by some artist. It was really wired, I shared the office with him for some time.
> He always came with that dog of him which…«
>
> »Hmm…you previously talked about creating a cover for the book –
> you said that you try several designs. Can you describe how you try them?«


### Referring back to check your understanding

You can refer back to answers to check your grasp of what
the participant talked about. In this case, even closed (yes/no) questions are ok.

> »I saw you choose the color from that palette down there – is this the
same palette you choose the background color from?« »No, it is not –
the palette I am using here is…«

or

> »So: If I want to print something first I need to ask for their color
profile, when I have this, I load it in InDesign, choose the profile
in the pdf dialog and then export it?« »Yes. I usually to a test
afterwards by opening the pdf in addition«
\
\

Jumping back to some previously mentioned topic may seem difficult, since you need to remember some particular information (to refer to it later) while carrying on with the research. However, it is not that hard – just give it a try. As well, keep in mind that you can make brief notes reminding you of things that are of interest. With a look on your
note sheet they will return to your memory in case you forgot about them.


## How exactly would you do it?  


After you ask a question,  participants will sometimes answer *»in general«*


> »In general, I have a workflow of these steps: Research, Ideation,
Creation, Evaluation. So in research I…«


It may seem great – after all, a general process which you can apply to
just about anything is a finding we seem want! But actually these *»in
general«* descriptions pose some problems: Since they are general and thus abstract
they lack a rich context and stand rather disconnected to other
activities or motivations. A general principle is independent of
such »minor« day to day things. But these seemingly trivial informations about the
context of activities  give us the insights we need to find out why and how the participant is
doing something in the real, particular situation. Such »general« procedures may as well
be heavily idealized and rarely applied in the way they are described.

A way to get  real-world, rich data is to ask for an example. Thus, you
don’t blatantly reject the »general« answer but you convey that you are interested and
want to understand it better:


> Can you show me an example of how you put that principles into
 practice?


You can as well ask  for a specific occasion of the »general« happening or being
done. The answer will be give the context of the activities happening in an actual situation.


> In the magazine project – can you describe how your design process was
 there?


Or


> »Can you show me how you do this in the project you are working on now  – if that makes sense?«


Very often you may discover that the reality is far less consistent and
far more context-depended then in the general examples. The findings are more
interesting and inspiring as well:


> Participant: »Well, in this project we have a tight deadline. So we needed to speed
 up. So I did some research… well, I reused some I did have from a
 similar project…  and talked to a fellow student who did something
 similar. And then…«


By asking for examples and specific events instead of context-free
generalizations, you can get more information and avoid doing research on
»general«, possibly not actually practiced ways of work.

## Wrap it up

When you covered the topics you wanted to know about and explored them
sufficiently by asking questions and observing it may be time to wrap up the research session.

I made the experience that after 30 minutes I covered the general questions.
However, getting to know complex workflows takes longer. Same goes for getting deeper insights
into (work) culture. As well, using observations will need some time too. So if you go beyond a simple
interview you should plan 1-2h for one research session.

Don’t let this estimations fence you in: You will develop some
intuition for the flow of the research session and how long it should take.

Keep in mind that the research session should be comfortable for the participant.
If he/she looks absent, yawns etc. it is probably time to wrap it up.

Before I finish I go through my cheat sheet and see if I did cover my
questions.  I try to summarize what I learned from the participant
by going through my notes and verbalize the information. You can
even announce it like this:


> This was very interesting. To wrap it up I want to give a brief
summary of what I learned. Please feel free to correct me, if I
misunderstood something! So: Your, you said that your work is to…


When verbalizing what you learned, the participant can fill gaps and clarify any misunderstandings.
It is also a good way to fade out the research session.

When you finished going though your notes and giving your summary, thank the participant for
taking the time. If you have any incentives or compensation, give them
to the participant. In addition, I try to give an outlook on the next steps in the
research to let the participant know how the data matters for
me:


> My next steps would be going though audio and notes. After
anonymizing what we recorded, me and my colleague analyze the data and the
data from other research sessions to find out how graphic designers work.
>
> We will try to improve our products by making it more suitable to this
workflow.



## Recording Data

### Notes


![making notes on a clipboard](images/notizenKlemmbrett.jpg){.portrait}

<!-- SECTION: INTRO -->

During the interview you will take brief notes. This is rather similar like taking notes in school or university: You go for the gist of what was said but you don't write down the exact words (Except in the case you find a particular expression itself important). One utterance or observation concerning one topic goes in one line, bullet-point style.

\ 
<!-- SECTION: TECHNIQUE -->

Your main taks in the interview is to listen and to observe. When you look at your notesheet and think about what the write down, listening and observing don't work well. Try too keep it as unobstrusive as possible. 

* If you don’t care too much about your handwriting you can write notes without much looking at the paper except for some occasional glances (the method has its limits, though)
* Because of the difficulties of balancing observing, listening and notetaking, there are obvious benefits of a partner who does the research with you. One person can ask questions and guide through the research, the other person takes notes. Both observe and listen.
* <!-- audio: you can afford to skip writing down verbatim comments of the person; -->
If you record audio in paralell you can be more relaxed when writing what was *said*. However, you still need to take notes to keep what you observed. This can also be very useful when you listen to the audio later and wonder what was referred to when the participant refers to things as »it« and »that« – without notes it can be hard to reconstruct what the participant was talking about. 

\ 

<!-- expect to write lots of notes. Depending on person. For 30 min 2 DINA4-->
When I take notes in research I write often about 1 A4 page each 15min., sometimes more, sometimes less. So it does not make sense to try to write everything on one sheet or even in some space left on the cheat-sheet with your questions on it.

\ 
<!-- SECTION: CONTENT --> 
You will supplement, transcribe and analyse your notes after the data gathering. Thus you need to be able to make sense of them later. Between collecting the data and reviewing your notes, the *context* is easily forgotten: If you just write «empty page« it may make totally sense at the moment you write that, seeing what is happening and  knowing what happend before and after. But without that implicit knowledge »empty page« does not make much sense. 

> Rather than »creates empty page« write
> »creates empty pages to organize drafts«
> 
> Instead of »changes objects« write
> »Changes object size to match grid«

\ 
<!--reflect.--> 
When you use your notes in subsequent steps you will read lines that don't make sense to you anymore or you feel the need for particular information. Note what was missing from the notes; maybe attach a brief comment on a sticky note to them. This is useful to learn how to take better notes. 

### Audio

Unlike making notes on paper, making an audio recording is a rather passive process except
 for pressing the record button.

I recommend using audio recordings – it is a useful supplement to your notes. It will record
the audio during the research session so that you can listen to what was said hereafter.
Note that it is not a perfect capture of all that happened: It records only sound, so if the
participant points to the screen and refers to »this«, the recording is not much of help.

### Photos
Making photos is rather easy and can capture lots of information. For example, you can
photograph the participant's desk to aid your memory. Later, you can go back and see
what was on it: Paper, pens, computer; were there tidy looking stacks and containers
for all the utensils? Or was it seemingly messy?

You can photograph the users screen if your research involves computers and gadgets.
Tech savvy users may cringe since a software based screenshot is technically superior –
but if the user does not know you to make a screenshot, a camera is a handy way to capture
the screen.

You should be able to make  photos with your camera quickly and reliably.
Thus, use a device you know and which has a good auto-mode.
The only setting that I use beyond that is the exposure compensation
in case an important part of the image totally dark or disappears in light.
Exposure compensation allows adjusting for that.

Avoid complicated set-ups or even arranging the participant and his/her tools. Arranging the participant and his/her
tools would change the data you record.

### Sketches
The Observations you make are, by nature, visual and concerned with processes.
Make sketches or even little storyboards to capture what you see.

It is very useful that you can choose what to draw: highlight what is important, leave out what is
irrelevant and make annotations to ease understanding the sketches later.

I mostly use my sketches the same way I use notes: Notes and sketches are made on a common
sheet of paper; one sketched observation goes in one line, if possible
