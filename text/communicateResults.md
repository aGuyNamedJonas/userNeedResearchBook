# Communicate Results

If you work with others, the results of your research need
to be communicated.

Aside from getting the results of your research across, communicating
your results has some positive side effects: collecting, organizing and
summarizing your findings will make it easier for yourself to remember
your findings and you may be even able to improve your analysis further.

Keep in mind that the »right« way of communicating research results is
highly dependent on several factors: The skills and knowledge of the
audience, the goals of the project in general (the research in
particular) and the kind of reports your audience is used to.

So what I describe here can only be seen as a general introduction: I
try not to focus on particular forms of deliverables but show you the
elements you can combine in different media to communicate your results.

## Getting it across

It can be hard to make an impact with your research: If it is not clear why the
results of your research matter they are easily dismissed

Probably the best form to communicate your research is to do the
research (at least partly) with others. Those who do the research with
you will know first-hand how it was done and what the results were. In
addition, they will probably identify themselves with the research and
its outcomes and might support your cause.

However, this is not always possible and you may need to resort to a
less interactive, more typical form of communication – like writing
reports and making presentations. When you communicate your results in
this way, keep in mind that reports and slides may easily end up as
»dead documents« – informations which are available but are not used.

To make this less likely to happen, find out what the interests of the
document’s audience are and how you can communicate with them to get
their attention.  

## Who is your audience?

Consider the audience’s needs when communicating.  If
you want a programmer to understand you, you might highlight different
aspects and use different words compared to presenting the results to
your professor or boss. Think about what matters for those who should
listen to you and structure your information accordingly: If your
professor cares about novel ways of interaction, highlight aspects that
might help when developing them; if some people you work with think that
»users don’t get it«, emphasize the reasons for the behavior of the
people you studied.

Keep in mind that the jargon that might be used by others has its own
rules. Only use words and concepts that will be understood by your
audience and which you know yourself – don’t fake it.

## Explain your Research

You should not only communicate your results but as well how you got to
them. This permits others to evaluate your research in the context of the
explained methods and enables you to show that you arrived at your
results using an empirical and structured approach.

### Describe your Methods

Explain the research methods you used to arrive at your results. This
includes:

-   Selection of participants (sampling)
-   Data gathering
-   Data analyis



> I recruited the participants by asking on mailing lists, bulletin boards
and in Facebook groups. The request was like this:
>
> »We, a team of students of the Weimar University, want to improve the
free layout program frame drawer and want the application to match your
workflow and needs. Therefore we would like to gather some insights in
the way you work.
>
> If you would like to support us, someone from our team would visit your
workplace and ask you some questions and look over your shoulder while
you work. This would take approximately 1h.
>
> All participants get a \$10 voucher for the university's cafeteria. If
you would like to participate (or have further questions) please write a
mail to jan.dittrich@example.com«
>
> **Data gathering**
>
> We gathered the data by asking open questions in a semi-structured
interviews. In addition, we observed the research participants doing
their work. The participants were invited to just continue to work on
what they would have done when we would not have been there.
>
> The data gathering was done by single researchers, though one session
was done by two team members together (one taking notes, the other
asking the questions)
>
> We recorded the data by doing an audio recording of questions and
answers in addition to handwritten notes. We photographed and sketched participants
during key activities and made photos and sketches of tools important to
their work.
>
> **Analysis**
>
> After the research sessions we gathered all notes and supplemented
forgotten or unclear data by using the audio recordings and sketches. We
annotated all data for possible meanings and interrelations to create a
preliminary scheme for organizing the data into meaningful principles.
This patterns served as a starting point for organizing and reordering
the data during several iterations. Thus, the process was similar to
affinity diagramming (Beyer, Holtzblatt) or Thematic Analysis (Virginia,
Clarke)


### Describe site and sample

To make your research less abstract for the audience, give an
introduction to the environment you did the research in. Describe it in
a way that allows others to imagine it, for example by showing sketches,
photos of tools or the participant’s workplace. Remember to show only
what the participants agreed to share with you and the audience.

In addition to the context, describe your research participants by
giving a general user profile. Thus you don’t share any personal data of
anyone but allow your audience to have some ideas of the participants.



> Participants were students (four of them) or recent graduates (one of
them).  All had studied several terms already and had work experiences
from at least one internship. Four were female, one were male.
>
> All participants were asked to meet with us at the place where they
usually work. Partly this was in their flats; We met one participant in
a shared working space and one remotely via telephone and screensharing.

## Components of deliverables and reports

Let me give a brief overview of typical building blocks for
communicating your research. They are all useful on their own and you
can combine them to use their strengths together.

### Text

Text is as very versatile way to convey informations. On the downside,
text may seem not as quickly accessible as a diagram or a sketch. To
lower the barriers, make sure that people know why they are reading
your text. Give essential information at the beginning (What is this
text about? Why was the work done?) and make sure that it is easy to get
a quick overview:  Structure your text using headings, lists and
italics to guide the reader.

![a page spread from a report](images/exampleWrittenReport.png)


There are lots of books which explain how to write concise and
easy-to-get text. The most efficient guide I know was given by George
Orwells in »Politics and the English Language« – I quote:




> 1. Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you
 are used to seeing in print.
>
> 2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
>
> 3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
>
> 4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.  
>
> 5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if
    you can think of an everyday English equivalent.  
>
> 6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything barbarous.
^[[Orwell’s Rules for writers](http://wikilivres.ca/wiki/Politics_and_the_English_Language)]

In addition, read the text aloud – in particular, if you already noticed
that you have had difficulties finding the right word or to express a
complicated concept. If you need to re-read sentences to make sense of
them or to stress the right words, you should go for a rewrite.

### Quotes

Quotes convey the participant’s motivations and feelings. This is
important to help others to have empathy with the users.


> **Rather abstract:** Users like the alignment function
>
> **Combined with Quote**: Users like the alignment function. Sandy: »It is
like doing work by magic – click! And its there!«

Remember to protect the participant's identity if they did not give you
the permission to share their quotes or names. If they did not give you
the permission, only share a plausible, but faked »quote« and don't use
real names but faked ones as well. Don’t deceive your audience either:
mention that the names and quotes are not real but are only
corresponding to their actual counterparts.

### Scenarios

Activities don’t happen in isolation from each other: They depend on
previous activities and (possible changing) motivations. One way to
communicate a sequence of interrelated activities is a scenario. Simply
put, a scenario is a short story written as text or given as a sequence
of images (like a comic)

A good framework for writing scenarios is asking yourself these
questions:

-   **Person**: Who is the main person in the scenario?
-   **Motivations**: Why does this person what he/she does? What is the
    motivation?
-   **Activities**: What are the actions of the person and how are they
    done?  
-    **Context**: Where and When does the scenario take place?  

Answer them in your scenario.

> Annika studies media culture and needs to finish here homework
on »Cultural subconceptualist theory in the works of Koons« in order to
hand the homework in on time. She goes to the library to see if the book
on »Capitalism in the works of Rushdie« by Andreas Geoffrey contains
arguments supporting her view on the structuralist paradigm.
>
> She enters the library and walks up to one of the computers standing in the corners of the library's halls.
>
> She wants to look up the name of the author, but she notes that she
forgot the copy of the book that referenced the work. She still knows
that »Rusdie« or »Rushdie« was in the title of the book she needs. After
several trials she finds the right spelling of the name and, after
scanning through a list, she finds the book she wants to read. The
detail page of the search application gives the address of the library
building she is in already and a code: »X0-3R52«… \[scenario may continue\]

You could as well create a scenario as a series of sketches, like a comic strip:

<div class="gallery four">

![remembering the code. Is it a zero or the letter ›O‹?](images/szenario2_2.png){.portrait}

![I can’t find the right shelf!](images/szenario2_3.png){.portrait}

![I'd better ask somebody… now I know where I need to go! ](images/szenario2_4.png){.portrait}

</div>



### Diagrams

![A diagram showing the workflow in creating a software](images/flowDiagram.svg)


Diagrams are useful to show high-level concepts, relations and
dependencies – for example showing which activities need to be done to
create a page of a magazine or the ways a group of students share files
when working together on a joint project.


### Photos and Illustrations

Which one is easier to understand and less ambiguous:

This:


> The participant’s desk is rather tidy. In front of the keyboard is
a book and on the book a calculator. Left hand are additional utilities,
like…


Or that:

![](images/ObservationDesignU4Workplace.jpg)

I suppose the image wins.

While the above example just shows a setting, we could as well combine
the strengths of text and images in an annotated photo.

Or you could show your general findings about how people organize their
desktops by sketching a prototypical arrangement of items.

Illustrations and photos in particular have another function aside of
getting information across: They make the research and its findings more
graspable, intuitive and »real« for your audience. Just like scenarios
and quotes they enable to imagine how your research participants acted
which in turn helps to develop empathy for them. Consider again our
example from above in which an image and a text were compared. The photo
does not only give some abstract information. It shows that you have
been with actual participant or – in this case – did research on actual
tools they use.

When using photos, remember to protect the privacy of your participants.
Only show photos of their workplaces or of themselves if they agreed to
it.

## Typical Documents for reporting results (»Deliverables«)


You can combine text, images diagrams and scenarios in several ways to
communicate your message. Let’s look at some possibilities.

### Quick findings

Quick findings are short, annotated lists of your most important
findings. They include a brief description of methods, participants and
environment and usually a disclaimer that this is only a very brief
summary and that the  (preliminary) results may be refined later.

Quick findings are very useful if your audience :

-   already know about your research and want to have a look at your progress
-    have very little time, and need efficient access to your  results

### Written Reports

Written reports are roughly four to a several dozen pages long.
Nevertheless, only deliver what the audience needs and wants to know –
be concise. It is easy to get sidetracked and to write length and
complex sentences.

Written reports consist mainly of text, but you should use images,
quotes and diagrams too when they make sense.

I suggest the following structure for your reports:

-   summary of the key facts and findings
-   Why: Research interest
-   How: Research methods
-   Who and Where: Describe participants and site
-   Your findings
-   Conclusions and suggestions

### Slides

Slides can deliver the same content as written reports or quick
findings. They convey the information in a more visual way – so they
have fewer text and more images, diagrams, and storyboards.

If you give the presentation yourself try to deliver as few as possible
of the information by text on the slides. You can do the talking and the
slides supplement the information you give. On the other side, it may
makes sense to use more text on the slides if you just share the slides
with others and don’t present them yourself.
