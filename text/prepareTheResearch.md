# Prepare the research session

## What do you want to find out?  {#questiontopics}

Before you collect the data, you should specify what you want to find out. Based on that you can gather questions you want to ask.
Let’s look at some topics that might be of interest exploring:

I usually have three aspects I think of when I prepare my questions:

1.  Motivations, what the user wants to archive, what is important for him/her?
2.  Activities, what does the user? 
3.  Problems: what interferes with the users activities and motivations?

There could be many other aspects, but I find these three good because

* They  cover a wide range of possible topics questions
* They cover design relevant topics
* They can be easily remembered even in the midst of research: Three points are few and in addition you can use the mnemonic M-A-P: **M**otivations,**A**ctivities, **P**roblems.

Let me show you the questions I came up with for finding out about the needs of designers who create layouts.

####  Activities

> -   Can you describe the task you are currently working on?
> -   Can you show me how you create a graphic/layout?
> -   Can you show me how you use the application?


Talking about activities or observing them is a very rich source of
information.
When asking about activities you can often use  follow up questions
to find out why and how users do what they do: *»You said, you apply paragraph styles. What do they do?«*
or *»You just used that ›align‹ function – before, you placed objects manually. What is the difference between those activities?.«*

####  Motivations

> -   Can you describe the worst experience in your day so far?
> -   Can you describe the best experience in your day so far?
> -   Which tasks in your job do you like the least?
> -   Which tasks in your job do you like the most?
> -   Can you show me a piece of work you are proud of?


Questions about Motivations are usually about emotions and often their relation to activities as well.
You can explore these relations further in follow-up questions – »You said you hate talking with this client. What in particular makes it a bad experience for you?«.

####  Problems


> -  When do you feel hindered or slowed down?
> -  Can you show me how you circumvent this from happening?
> -  What will happen if you can’t solve this problem?

Asking for problems provides some good starting points for designing since you can try to avoid the problems with a better solution.

Problems are easily communicated and the need for a solution is often very clear. Thus they provide a good starting point when convincing others …

* …that changes to a product/concept need to be made
* …that your research makes sense and helps to avoid such problems.

However, only dealing with problems would lead to patching existing solutions. If you want to create new ways of approaching things, you need to connect problems to the underlying motivations by asking for the difficulties a problem causes.

Naturally, the three general aspects of activities, motivations and problems are just giving you a starting point for developing your questions.
Use them to create questions suitable for your own research.

When you have started with gathering data you can further refine your questions.
You will get new ideas or you may want to refine the aims of your reserach since may haved noticed shortcomings or opportunities.

For example, in the research on graphic design I noticed that idea generation during work was important for the participants and an interesting topic to research.
Thus, I added questions like »How do you generate new ideas?« or »How do you know if an idea you have works?«.

Note that I did not ask directly »Do you generate ideas while implementing designs?«.
This would be a question that  urges to be answered with »yes« or »no«.
Such short answers do not yield the context we need, the reasons for actions and the course of events to know not only how work is done but why it is done.

In later sections we will have a further look at the do's and dont’s of questions.

## Write a cheat sheet  

You should ensure that questions you prepare are still on your mind when
doing the interview. A good way to ensure this is to taking a cheat sheet (more formally also called »Interview Guide«) along.

What goes into such a sheet? The biggest part will be **questions** which you
created beforehand (take a look at [»What do you want to find out?«](#questiontopics)  for
collecting possible questions). When you write the questions on the cheat sheet,
start with the general topics and progress towards more specific ones.
This is the order that makes sense in the course of a research session.
Nevertheless, that order is only a helpful guess. You will usually deviate a bit (or a lot) from your cheat
sheet.

Often I include some kind of **checklist** on the top, especially if
there are legal matters involved, such as signing a consent form. Thus I
can tick off what we already dealt with and immediately see if I forgot something.

As a beginner you may have some difficulties with formulating your
questions without preparations when spontaneously entering on a new subject that
happens to emerge in the research session.

In this case you can help yourself along with some reminders on the sheet, like
»Activities/Motivations/Problems«, »How and Why«, or, for the graphics design topic:
»creativity/variations/creative rules/technology« or the like.

The cheat sheet is a tool to support you during the interview and help you along when your
mind goes blank for a moment. It is not for ensuring that you ask all questions in the same
way and in the same order.  Instead of controlling the situation user need research emphasizes
the importance of exploring a given situation and it’s peculiarities. It is totally ok and even
beneficial to come up with new questions which are not on the cheat sheet, or to react towards
a new topic the participant brings up if you have the impression that this will give you new
and interesting insights.


## Equipment  

With a participant talks about new and interesting things you want to
be able to remember what was said. Thus we record the interview – and we
will need some equipment for doing that:

![Equipment for user research: paper, pen, audio recorder](images/interviewEquipment.svg)


- for note taking and sketching
	-   Paper, lined or blank (15 or more sheets, just to be on the save side)
	-   Pencil or Pen (Don't forget to bring backups!)
	-   Something to write on. A clipboard is great.
-  Audio Recording (recommended)
	- audio recorder or smartphone
-  Photos and video (recommended)
	- a digital camera or smartphone
	
You should get to know your equipment before you start the actual data collection. So be sure to know the essential operations to actually make a photo and start and stop the recording. Check the audio quality by putting the phone/recorder roughly a meter away from you and saying some sentences in normal loudness. Listen to the recording to test if you can (easily) understand what you said.
