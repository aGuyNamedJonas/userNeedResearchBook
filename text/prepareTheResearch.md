# Prepare your research

## Create a user focused how-and-why question based on the initial idea for the project  {#questiontopics}

In ______ <!-- todo Reference --> I described, that our research will start from an (rough) idea for a future market, product or feature. To get to know our users we must transform these ideas for an outcome into questions for our research that concern people, not product.

First I ask myself why the product idea would be good for something people do. Then I ask how and why they do this. The outcome can be used as research question.

Here are some examples:

* The initial idea is *»build a learning platform for university students«*
* The meaningful activity connected to it can be *»using digital media to learn better for university«*
* Asking *how* and *why* I come to *»How and why do students use computers to learn better for university?«*
* I then refined the question a bit, since *learning better* is often understood as remembering facts or passing exams. Also, the »computer« was sounding like if I am not interested e.g. in smartphones or use of social networks. I went with »How and why do students use digital media related to their studies«.

Or look at this one

* … <!-- TODO -->

The research question is a help for you to form more detailed questions and to communicate your aims. It does not need to be the *one true question*. Thus, it can also be refined later, maybe because of research results and a better understanding of what matters.

## Find participants

In user research you want to find out what our users do and how and why they do it. If we know this, we can design our products accordingly.

To be able to do research on the »how« and »why« of user’s work, you need to find people who would like to answer your questions and would show you what they do. These people are our (research) participants.

### Potential participants do the activity that is in your research question

Research participants should be able to talk about and demonstrate what they do. Because of this, it makes sense to focus on activities when you recruit.

For other methods, the criteria are more demographic like »30year old male, making $50k/year and being interested in technology«. But this is not very helpful when we want to learn about motivations, activities and problems of people.

If, for example you have the research question
*»How and why do students use computers to learn better for university?«* the activity is »learning for university«. This is what you should focus on: Find people who learn for university. There is also the role »student«, which for this purposes does not add much.

If your question is »How and why do Wikipedia editors switch language versions«, the activity is »switching language versions«, additionally constraint by the role: »Wikipedia editors«. So your would try to find people who edit Wikipedia and switch language versions. If that is too focused on the switching process, you could try to find editors who edit in several language versions (assuming they would switch languages, too).

I don't exclude the roles, but usually I focus on the activities first. In a question »How and why do programmers organize their code«, the essential part is organizing the code. Yes, it is a pretty good guess that programmers do that activity. But if you got designers, artists or data analysts who code, you can learn a lot from these people as well.

### Collect participants where they are

I assume that you don't have the money to employ a recruiting agency to get your participants. Thus, you will need to find and ask them yourself. Think of methods to make possible participants aware of your research and the possibility to participate. For example, participants could be found among

- Employees of other departments
- Friends and family
- The people who see your posts on social media
- The people who visit your or your companies homepage
- Participants of meetings/gatherings.

To find the right participants for your research, try to find out where those people are: users of a
particular software can be found on mailing lists, forums and user meetings or events.
Young adults could be found via bulletin boards on on university or college campus.
Retired people may be found in church congregation and retirement homes.

Inform possible participants about the study and what they can expect when they participate.
Regardless of how you inform them – if by speaking directly to them, by using a note on a blackboard
or by writing an email –  you should give them the following information:

- The purpose of the study and the resulting benefits for the participant or the wider community (e.g. a product which is more suitable to their needs)
- The research method (answering questions and observation)
- The time frame (ranging usually from 30min-2h)
- Incentives (if you can afford it)
- Your contact information


> **Are you a designer?**
>
> We, a team of students of the Weimar University,  want to improve the free layout program frame
drawer and want the application to match your workflow and needs.
Therefore, we would like to gather some insights in the way you work.
>
> If you would like to support us, someone from our team would visit your workplace and ask you some
questions and look over your shoulder while you work.
This would take approximately 1h.
>
> All participants get a $10 voucher for the university's cafeteria.
If you would  like to participate (or have further questions) please write a mail to jan.dittrich@example.com


When you reach out to communities for recruiting be sure to comply to the rules of the organizations or social groups involved.
It does not help your research if the community you target gets upset with you for violating their privacy and customs.
If you are unsure, just ask.
These people you ask, lets say a clergyman or a meetup organizer may even be able to set you up with people who can help you.
Once you started your research  you can ask  participants if they know other people who match your ideas of possible participants.
It is likely that they know some other people who work in the same job or have similar hobbies. (In the literature, this is also called *»Snowball sampling«*)

### Make compromises, if needed

Especially if you are on your own, you may need to compromise and do research with participants that don't match your intended users exactly. When doing this, keep in mind to check for similarity of tasks, problems and motivations. These checks don't ensure that the participants are exactly the ones who may use your final product. But you can help to be rather sure that they can tell you something that is of interest for you.

If you design an app for people to create bibliographies and you can only get some bachelors and masters students, but no professors, your results will still reveal a lot about the processes of creating bibliographies. The student’s motivation is probably writing final term papers and the professors would like to write journal papers. This is a possible difference. But as long as you aware of it, you are probably fine. But if you want to design a skateboard and the only participants you can get are elderly people who enjoy hiking, you are in trouble (if you find elderly people who enjoy skating, go for it).


### A small number of participants is fine

There are no clear cut rules of how many participants are enough. However, most of my projects have between 3 and 8 participants.
If I really need to be sure that what I notice is consistent I'd do research with 10, but that is about the limit I can manage on my own.

When estimating how many participants you need, consider how much resources (time and/or money) you can spend on doing the research. Each additional participant gives you additional data and a broader view on your possible users. However, each research session needs time do and adds to the amount of data to be analyzed – so plan accordingly.

An efficient way of involving the »right« amount of participants is doing your research iteratively: start with two or three participants and analyze the data (how this is done is described in the section on [Analysing Data](#Analysis))

Take a look at the (preliminary) findings: If the results seem clear and consistent, you may do research with few additional participants to refine and check and to explore details – or, if time is up, leave it the way it is.

If preliminary findings are unclear or contradictory, you may need to involve more participants.

Reasons for the such unsatisfactory results could be:

* Your research encompasses different groups of people with different needs – For example the groups »students« and »professors« share some traits, but many characteristics will vary.
* The topic of your research is too broad – for example, »How do people do design« is very broad, »How do interface designers involve specifications of user research and engineers in their designs« is more specific.
* Even if your research is focused and there is only one group of people involved, the actual patterns just vary.

In all these cases you can involve more participants – but before you do involve more participants try to check if you…

* …need to clarify your research topic (to focus your efforts)
* …need to specify the involved groups (to recruit the right participants)

<!-- NOTE: Less back and forth in the following paragraphs would  be good. -->

You may think that conducting user research with more participants is generally better; you just could shorten each session, ask fewer questions and skip observing the participants. But you need time with each participant if you want to find out about the »how« and »why« of the participants’ work. Several sessions in hurry will lead to less useful results than research with one participant done right.

Nevertheless, only doing research on very few users will restrict the variance of data – like noticing that there may be several ways to do the same thing. As well you might not see which patterns are consistent among several people and which vary – which would certainly be impossible if you only had one or two participants. However, despite the constraints of such small samples they can still lead the helpful insights.

## Prepare the research session

The »Research session« is your time with the participant in which you listen to them and observe. If you are prepared, it helps you to focus on the tasks at hand.

### Write a cheat sheet
<!--What is an interview guide for? Prepare the questions etc. Prepare youself… -->

A cheat sheet is a little memory aid that you can take with you when you collect data.

What goes into such a sheet? The biggest part will be **questions** that you might want to ask. Read the chapter on data gathering

<!-- FIXME: LINK to chapter-->

<!-- TODO: Example for a research guide  -->

When you write the questions on the cheat sheet,
start with the general topics and progress towards more specific ones.
This is the order that makes sense in the course of a research session.
Nevertheless, that order is only a helpful guess. You will usually deviate a bit (or a lot) from your cheat
sheet.

Often I include some kind of **checklist** on the top, especially if
there are legal matters involved, such as signing a consent form. Thus I
can tick off what we already dealt with and immediately see if I forgot something.

<!-- As a beginner you may have some difficulties with formulating your
questions without preparations when spontaneously entering on a new subject that
happens to emerge in the research session.

In this case you can help yourself along with some reminders on the sheet, like
»Activities/Motivations/Problems«, »How and Why«, or, for the graphics design topic:
»creativity/variations/creative rules/technology« or the like. -->

The cheat sheet is a tool to support you during the interview and help you along when your
mind goes blank for a moment. It is not for ensuring that you ask all questions in the same
way and in the same order.  Instead of controlling the situation user need research emphasizes
the importance of exploring a given situation and it’s peculiarities. It is totally OK and even
beneficial to come up with new questions which are not on the cheat sheet, or to react towards
a new topic the participant brings up if you have the impression that this will give you new
and interesting insights.


### Take along tools that help you to record data easily 

With a participant talks about new and interesting things you want to
be able to remember what was said. Thus we record the interview – and we
will need some equipment for doing that:

![Equipment for user research: paper, pen, audio recorder](images/interviewEquipment.svg)


- for note taking and sketching
	-   Paper, lined or blank (15 or more sheets, just to be on the save side)
	-   Pencil or Pen (Don't forget to bring backups!)
	-   Something to write on. A clipboard is great.
-  Audio Recording (recommended)
	- audio recorder or smartphone <!-- TODO link to record audio -->
-  Photos and video (recommended)
	- a digital camera or smartphone <!-- link to record photos -->
- for drawing diagrams with the participant
	-   templates <!-- : link to diagrams -->
	-   pencils and/or pens in different colors

You should get to know your equipment before you start the actual data collection. So be sure to know the essential operations to actually make a photo and start and stop the recording. Check the audio quality by putting the phone/recorder roughly a meter away from you and saying some sentences in normal loudness. Listen to the recording to test if you can (easily) understand what you said.


<!--
Let me show you the questions I came up with for finding out about the needs of designers who create layouts.

####  Activities

> -   Can you describe the task you are currently working on?
> -   Can you show me how you create a graphic/layout?
> -   Can you show me how you use the application?


Talking about activities or observing them is a very rich source of
information.
When asking about activities you can often use  follow up questions
to find out why and how users do what they do: *»You said, you apply paragraph styles. What do they do?«*
or *»You just used that ›align‹ function – before, you placed objects manually. What is the difference between those activities?.«*

####  Motivations

> -   Can you describe the worst experience in your day so far?
> -   Can you describe the best experience in your day so far?
> -   Which tasks in your job do you like the least?
> -   Which tasks in your job do you like the most?
> -   Can you show me a piece of work you are proud of?


Questions about Motivations are usually about emotions and often their relation to activities as well.
You can explore these relations further in follow-up questions – »You said you hate talking with this client. What in particular makes it a bad experience for you?«.

####  Problems

> -  When do you feel hindered or slowed down?
> -  Can you show me how you circumvent this from happening?
> -  What will happen if you can’t solve this problem?

Asking for problems provides some good starting points for designing since you can try to avoid the problems with a better solution.

Problems are easily communicated and the need for a solution is often very clear. Thus they provide a good starting point when convincing others …

* …that changes to a product/concept need to be made
* …that your research makes sense and helps to avoid such problems.

However, only dealing with problems would lead to patching existing solutions. If you want to create new ways of approaching things, you need to connect problems to the underlying motivations by asking for the difficulties a problem causes.



Naturally, the three general aspects of activities, motivations and problems are just giving you a starting point for developing your questions.
Use them to create questions suitable for your own research.

When you have started with gathering data you can further refine your questions.
You will get new ideas or you may want to refine the aims of your research because you
 noticed shortcomings or opportunities.

For example, in the research on graphic design I noticed that idea generation during work was important for the participants and an interesting topic to research.
Thus, I added questions like »How do you generate new ideas?« or »How do you know if an idea you have works?«.

Note that I did not ask directly »Do you generate ideas while implementing designs?«.
This would be a question that  urges to be answered with »yes« or »no«.
Such short answers do not yield the context we need, the reasons for actions and the course of events to know not only how work is done but why it is done.

In later sections we will have a further look at the do's and dont’s of questions.

-->

<!-- -----------------------

My standard template is: *How and why do [People] [Activity]*, e.g. *»How and why do editors write on wikipedia?«* or *»How and why do master students organize their sources when writing term papers?«*

After I choose such a general question I think of some some topics that might be of interest exploring:

I usually have three aspects I think of when I prepare my research:

1.  Motivations, what the user wants to archive, what is important for him/her?
2.  Activities, what does the user do?
3.  Problems: what interferes with the users activities and motivations?

There could be many other aspects, but I find these three good because

* They cover a wide range of possible topics questions
* They cover design relevant topics
* They can be easily remembered even in the midst of research: Three points are few and in addition you can use the mnemonic M-A-P: **M**otivations, **A**ctivities, **P**roblems.

Use this framework (or any other guidance) to expand your research question and write down your existing assumptions and open questions. A mindmap can be a useful tool, here.


Your collected questions and assumptions can then guide you to find the right participants for your research and to write a cheat sheet with questions and other instructions that are helpful in the research sessions. -->
