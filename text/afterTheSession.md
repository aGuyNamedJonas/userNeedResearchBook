# Review your data

After our research session we need to take care that we can use the rich data in our later analysis.

When collecting the data with the participant you will be very busy listening and thinking of following questions. So you may not be able to keep up with writing notes and drawing sketches. To make the most of our data, we supplement our notes, sketches and diagrams and add some information about the context of the data gathering to close gaps and to help us to keep all the data ordered.

There are two ways to supplement your data: From memory and from additional recordings, like an audio recording.

Supplementing your data should be done as soon as possible after the research session. I recommend to schedule the data gathering in a way that you have some time directly after the session to supplement and order your data.

## Supplement data from memory

I add data that I did not write down yet. In this case I *add* them, like


> \[ADDITION\]:
>
> *She looks at her sketches before she starts working*


or I supplement some *existing* point with additional information:

> Sketching paper kept ready. \[ADDITION\]: *In transit: in the backpack; at
the workplace: right on the desk*

You can give brief notes more meaning by adding context from your
memory:


> *She saves old ideas \[ADDITION\]: For later inspiration in other
projects*

When revising your sketches, redraw the lines if the sketch is ambiguous otherwise and add annotations if you think that they might ease interpreting the sketch later on.

Think of your future self: Some notes may make perfect sense to you now
but since memory fades, they will seem cryptic later. So supplement and
clarify your sketches and notes so you can comprehend them after your
memories of the experience have faded.


> I have line *»Big changes«* in my
Notes. I remember that I made this note when the participant told me that her colleagues make bigger
changes between to two versions of their designs than she does.
I added this information to the notes, since it provided a way to understand what the »big changes«
actually refer to.



Similarly, if my writing is rather messy, I rewrite some words to ensure
that I can later decipher what I wrote.

I write and draw my supplements in another color than the color of the original notes. When I wrote my notes
during the interview with a blue pen I use black for the supplements or
vice versa, since I like to be able to keep track of what I did in which
step of the process.

> In this scanned part of a note sheet you see how the supplements are
 used:

>**1)** These parts have been partly rewritten in black as it was too
 messy before. **2)** At the right you see an newly drawn annotated sketch
 that provides a visual representation (how the document is organized
 by inserting empty pages). **3.)** More information has been provided. It
 was »keeping for inspiration«, now its »keeping *old stuff* for
 inspiration«

Using different colors is useful for another type of supplement:
Ideas or remarks in connection to your notes. When I go
through the notes I often have some ideas for a design or a question
which I would like to further explore in a future interview.  I write them down in a third color or I prefix the note with *»IDEA:«* or *»QUESTION«* in order to prevent myself of mixing ideas with empirical data.

## Transcribe your notes

Since they are often written quickly, your notes will usually be rather incoherent: Single words, small sketches, and longer sentences will all be scattered on the paper. Tidy your data and transcribe the notes in a digital document.

![after transcription](images/exampleNotesTranscript.png)

In your digital transcript, put one statement (or whatever you consider to make sense on its own) in each line. Avoid tying together two separate statements on one line and, on the other hand, make sure that the data you put into one line is meaningful on its own and is not just a single word or a description which is free of any context and thus hard to set in relation to other data. This is a simple way of ensuring that we chunk our data in a way we can later use for the analysis.

To make this reasoning more clear, here are some examples:

> **Not meaningful on its own (means mostly: too short):**
>
> -  duplicate objects
> -  making space

If there is any way to add the actual context (out of the memory or using other notes)
these notes should be supplemented with that context which hopefully helps us to get to
know why are objects are duplicated and for which purpose is the space is made.


> **Too many statements in one line (means as well: too long):**
>
> - Duplicating pages to save old ideas is common. Later she goes back to the duplicates and looks at them when she needs inspiration
> - She tries to have enough space for the margins to write comments in; to do so, she shrinks the main text area. She says, she could as well try to make space at the bottom of the page, and use footnotes for the comments.


> **Reasonable (each line can stand on its own and does not to cover multiple issues at once)**
>
> - Duplicating objects to save old ideas for later inspiration
> - Make space for additional comments by shrinking main text area.
> - Alternative places for additional comments: Either right margin or bottom.


The notes from the research session and later added supplements from my memory get the same formatting in my documents since they are all data I gathered by listening or observing the participant. But I take care that later added design ideas and research questions
are still easily distinguishable from the actual data that I gathered in the research session.

## Possibly supplement from audio recordings

If you made a recording of your research session, use it to supplement and check data.

When the audio contains information which is not in the document or if it
supplements information that is already there, I pause the playback and write the
additional information in the document. So the process is very similar to supplementing your notes from memory.

> Audio recording: »…hmm I send it to my boss. She will check it. Now I go to that
other document, and see…«
>
> The notes say: »Send document via mail«
>
> So I add the information about the cause of sending the mail:
> »Send document via mail to the boss for checking.«

If you need to save time, go through your notes and see where they lack information. Then just jump
to the parts of the audio that might complement these sections.

## Order and archive your data

It should be easy to find out later which data was from which participant and how notes, sketches, diagrams and possible audio recordings fit together.

Take care that all sheets of paper and files have…:

* a participant code like P1 for the first, P2 for the second participant etc. This way you can later trace back which data belongs together
* The name of the project and the date. In your next or even a parallel project, you may have another “first” participant, and you don’t want to mix them up
* The filenames (or the names of the folders they are in) should carry the participant code, project name and possibly the method too, which may lead to lenghty filenames like: LMS_P1_diagram-sharingprocess.png (“LMS” being “Learning Management Systems”, the project name, “P1” is the participant code, “diagram” is the method and “sharingprocess” is the topic)
* You should look for possible interconnections between different kinds of data. Maybe the participant mentioned his messy desk and you have a photo of it? Add a line in your transcript, referring to the photo. Or the participant talks about the problems of sending data to the print shop and the printing process was part of a workflow diagram you both created? Write a brief line in your notes and the diagram to connect both.

If you take these steps you can still match project and participants later so you don't loose time or data because of mixups.

As a result of these steps you your now have a transcript of your notes, diagrams, sketches and photos with possible cross referencing annotations, participant codes, and descriptive filenames.
