# Review your data

After our research session we have our notes, sketches and possibly audio and photos.
Using these recordings as well as our memory we create a coherent document for
each participant which captures the research session and the recorded utterances and
observations.

## Supplement from memory

It is essential to take time as soon as possible after the research session 
to supplement your notes with information from your memory. While collecting
the data with the participant you will be very busy listening and
thinking of following questions. So you may not be able to keep up with
writing notes and drawing sketches. There is no need to worry since
usually you'll remember how to fill these gaps from your memory. But you
need to do it quickly. If you don’t do it right after the interview,
your memory fades and the chance to supplement the information is gone.

To supplement your notes of the research session just go through them
chronologically and add annotations.

A part of these additions are things that are not in the
notes yet but still in my memory. In this case I *add* them, like


> \[ADDITION\]:
>
> *She looks at her sketches before she starts working*


or I supplement some *existing* point with additional information:

> Sketching paper kept ready. \[ADDITION\]: *In transit: in the backpack; at
the workplace: right on the desk*

You can give brief notes more meaning by adding context from your
memory:


> *She saves old ideas \[ADDITION\]: For later inspiration in other
projects*

When revising your sketches, redraw the lines if the sketch is ambiguous otherwise and add annotations if you think that they might ease interpreting the sketch later on.

Think of your future self: Some notes may make perfect sense to you now
but since memory fades, they will seem cryptic later. So supplement and
clarify your sketches and notes so you can comprehend them after your
memories of the experience have faded.


> I have line *»Big changes«* in my
Notes. I remember that I made this note when the participant told me that her colleagues make bigger
changes between to two versions of their designs than she does.
I added this information to the notes, since it provided a way to understand what the »big changes«
actually refer to.



Similarly, if my writing is rather messy, I rewrite some words to ensure
that I can later decipher what I wrote.

I write and draw my supplements in another color than the color of the original notes. When I wrote my notes
during the interview with a blue pen I use black for the supplements or
vice versa, since I like to be able to keep track of what I did in which
step of the process.

> In this scanned part of a note sheet you see how the supplements are
 used:

>**1)** These parts have been partly rewritten in black as it was too
 messy before. **2)** At the right you see an newly drawn annotated sketch
 that provides a visual representation (how the document is organized
 by inserting empty pages). **3.)** More information has been provided. It
 was »keeping for inspiration«, now its »keeping *old stuff* for
 inspiration«

Using different colors is useful for another type of supplement:
Ideas or remarks in connection to your notes. When I go
through the notes I often have some ideas for a design or a question
which I would like to further explore in a future interview.  I write them down in a third color or
I prefix the note with *»IDEA:«* or *»QUESTION«* in order to prevent myself of mixing ideas
with empirical data.

Writing notes, drawing sketches and supplementing them hereafter will
enable you to preserve information in the most situations. However, for
complicated descriptions of workflows or if you just loose track by
accident, it might be useful to have a backup by using audio recording.

## Transcribe your Data {#TranscribeData}

Before yor analyze your data, you should transcribe it properly, so it can be easily formatted, copied and accessed.

Sketches and Photos need to be ordered and can be connected to the written notes. If you did an audio recording you can listen to it and correct, supplement and extend your notes.

The document which we create by doing do is our »Transcript« ^[»Transcript« often
means to (verbatim) transcribe audio data. So it is possible, that what I call a
»transcript« here (bringing any data into an accessible, but not-yet-analyzed form)
may not be a ›proper‹ transcript for somebody else]


### Transcribe your notes

Since they are often written quickly, your notes will usually be rather incoherent: Single words, small sketches, and longer sentences will all be scattered on the paper. Tidy your data and transcribe the notes in a digital document.

![before transcription](images/exampleNotesBeforeTranscript.png)

![after transcription](images/exampleNotesTranscript.png)

In your digital transcript, put one statement (or whatever you consider to make sense on its own) in each line. Avoid tying together two separate statements on one line and, on the other hand, make sure that the data you put into one line is meaningful on its own and is not just a single word or a description which is free of any context and thus hard to set in relation to other data. This is a simple way of ensuring that we chunk our data in a way we can later use for the analysis.

To make this reasoning more clear, here are some examples:

> **Not meaningful on its own (means mostly: too short):**
>
> -  duplicate objects
> -  making space

If there is any way to add the actual context (out of the memory or using other notes)
these notes should be supplemented with that context which hopefully helps us to get to
know why are objects are duplicated and for which purpose is the space is made.


> **Too many statements in one line (means as well: too long):**
>
> - Duplicating pages to save old ideas is common. Later she goes back to the duplicates and looks at them when she needs inspiration
> - She tries to have enough space for the margins to write comments in; to do so, she shrinks the main text area. She says, she could as well try to make space at the bottom of the page, and use footnotes for the comments.


> **Reasonable (each line can stand on its own and does not to cover multiple issues at once)**
>
> - Duplicating objects to save old ideas for later inspiration
> - Make space for additional comments by shrinking main text area.
> - Alternative places for additional comments: Either right margin or bottom.


The notes from the research session and later added supplements from my memory are treated alike
in my documents since they are all data I gathered by listening or observing
the participant. But I take care that later added design ideas and research questions
are still easily distinguishable from the actual data that I gathered in the research session.

### Sketches and Photos

Since my sketches are usually on the same sheet of paper as my notes, I review my sketches
when I am transcribing the notes.

If it makes sense, I summarize the information of the sketch in a line or two (since it is easier to work with text than with images).
Otherwise, I paste the sketch from a scan into the document with the transcript.

### Photos

Review your sketches and photos ideally together with your written notes.
Describe photos and sketches in one or two lines. In particular, supplement them with some context: Why did you make the photo, what is particularly interesting? What does the sketch or diagram show? This makes sense to understand and remember what is depicted. Also, it can sometimes be easier to work with texts than with images.

>
> For the photo above you might add the following line to your notes: »participant
> displays different font combinations in the layout application to see if
> the fonts go well together (see *U2-14-9-14_1.jpg* )«

In my written notes, I »link« to  photos or sketches by mentioning their filename like 

> See [U6_DesktopSetup.jpg]

Or I paste the images directly into the document.

### Audio

If you made a recording of your research session, use it to supplement and check your notes. 

Usually, I have the audio as a .mp3
and the notes as a typed out plaintext or wordprocessor document (see: [Transcribe Notes](#TranscribeData)), so I can open audio and transcript in parallel on my computer.

When the audio contains information which is not in the document or if it
supplements information that is already there, I pause the playback and write the
additional information in the document. So the process is very similar to supplementing
your notes from memory.

> Audio recording: »…hmm I send it to my boss. She will check it. Now I go to that
other document, and see…«
>
> The notes say: »Send document via mail«
>
> So I add the information about the cause of sending the mail:
> »Send document via mail to the boss for checking.«

If you need to save time, go through your notes and see where they lack information. Then just jump
to the parts of the audio that might complement these sections.

As a result of supplementing our notes from memory and by using the audio, sketches and
photos we now have a document which summarizes our research session. The data  is
mainly text-based though additional information is conveyed in sketches or photos.
