## Intro
**Problem:**
Find people and Prepare are maybe in the wrong order. Should we not prepare and then find people? On the other hand, prepare is very much split in itself, too: It has:
* prep for the whole research, but also 
* prep for the single session

**Possible solutions**: 
* Split into: Research question and session questions?
* Merge?

## Skewing answers
* The framing of "skewing" assumes that there is one true answer

## Ensure and encourage could get a "expose you non-knowledge" or so

## Should there be topics?
Like

* Finding out about Motivations
 * What is good about?
 * Can you describe a situation which made you feel good?
 * Why would you do _____?
* Finding out obout Activities
 * How do youâ€¦?
 * Why would you do _____?
 * 
* Finding out about Problems

## Extend: Check your understanding

## "Make sense of your notes" 

could be extended to maybe also include diagrams?
