## Intro
**Problem:**
Find people and Prepare are maybe in the wrong order. Should we not prepare and then find people? On the other hand, prepare is very much split in itself, too: It has:
* prep for the whole research, but also
* prep for the single session

**Possible solutions**:
* Split into: Research question and session questions?
* Merge?

OLD:
*Find People
 * How can I find participants?
 * Make compromises, if needed
 * How many participants do I need?
* Prepare the research session
 * What do you want to find out?
 * Write a cheat sheet
 * Equipment

NEW
* Prepare your research
 * What do you want to find out
 * Finding participants
 * …
## Skewing answers
* The framing of "skewing" assumes that there is one true answer

## BUG:
"Silence feels strange but is okay" and "Probing" have the same content, very close to each other.

Solution: Take the "silence" part over to probing; Instead give "silence…" a proper ending

## Ensure and encourage could get a "expose you non-knowledge" or so

## Should there be topics?
Position: between don't skew and closer look?

* Finding out about Motivations
 * What is good about?
 * Can you describe a situation which made you feel good?
 * Why would you do _____?
* Finding out about Activities
 * How do you…?
 * Why would you do _____?
* Finding out about Problems
 * Are there things that annoy you about…
 * Are there things that could be better at…
 * What do you do to work around…

 ## Ask for demonstration
…add to "take a closer look"

## Extend: Check your understanding

## "Make sense of your notes"

could be extended to maybe also include diagrams?
