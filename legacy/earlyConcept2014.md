> It seems at the point of writing, I mentioned “reflective” as being in contrast to positivist (which is not wrong, but there could be many “opposites” to positivist). I suppose it was meant to say that one needs to accept that one has a role in the process, data and analysis and is not a passive or to-be-without-influence part of it. 
> I somehow combined “Ethnography” and “Grounded Theory” as very method/process oriented. It applies to most variants of Grounded Theory, however, ethnography is far more opportunistic. 

– – WORK IN PROGRESS – –

target group: 
* Product-, service-, strategic designers; People who want to base future ideas on a sound foundation instead of guessing about their users
* AND: They don’t have a big budget for their projects (company does not see the need yet; startups;  they are students; do work for charity) 
* honestly: Myself. I was annoyed how much work it was to learn it the way I (tried) to write it. 
* NO TARGET: Big company user research, academics 

learning objectives:
* skills:
  * gather data
  * get meaningful results by analysis
* concepts: 
  * understand the nature of qualitative empirical research as different from “testing” 
  * Accept your own (creative) role in the process of data gathering and analysis
  * being reflective 

key messages: 
* Because you get to know users activities and the reasons behind them you gain a foundation for future product ideas and inspiration for possible fields to move in. 
* It is not difficult nor equipment-intensive (smartphone, pencil, paper) to do qualitative data gathering and analysis
* rather than judging “right” or “wrong”, be reflective and move forward step by step (Its different from all-or-nothing big after the fact usability testing or the like)

personal reasons:
* I would like to support people who put the (actual) user in the center of new ideas (and not some imagined user stereotypes), no matter (o.k., almost no) how much resources
* I’d like to get me and my methods known a bit better

market: 
* Contextual Design: Never got it working with 1 or 2 people (not a failure of CD; it is a team method, but not everybody has a 4+ Team involvable in user research) 
* Interviewing Users (Portigal): Pretty good, but company focus, not suitable for low budget and students.
* Grounded theory, ethnography etc.: too elaborate. I know nobody who does transcripts themselves (If they don't have to)  or does a multiple-iteration grounded theory sampling for needfinding research. Far too theory heavy, read-first-then-apply way of teaching. 
* Shane the lone ethnographer: academic focus, otherwise pretty much along the lines. Bonus: It is a comic.
