<h1 id="about-this-text"><a href="#about-this-text">About this text</a></h1>
<p>This book is written for all those who want to design products according to the needs of human beings. This text teaches you how to find potential users and how to find out about their activities, motivations and problems. I demonstrate how to analyze the gathered data in a way that makes it usable and useful for your design process.</p>
<p>To have knowledge about the »how« and »why« of the user’s work allows you to create innovative products that meet the users’ needs. As well, you can utilize this knowledge to improve existing products.</p>
<p>I will teach methods for user needs research in a way that is descriptive and allows quick application of the learned methods by using tools that are readily available to you. I give examples to demonstrate the use of methods in practice. I hope you can imagine yourself applying the described methods when reading – and I want to avoid teaching something that seems like mere theory to you.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong (especially if you are a seasoned researcher for user needs or a professional in some other social science field). It is not that I think theory is superfluous and should be avoided by practitioners. I just want to empower beginners by providing a start in the field which is hands-on and leads to visible results.</p>
<!---  TODO Intro about here --->

<h1 id="find-people"><a href="#find-people">Find People</a></h1>
<p>In user research we want to find out what our users do and how and why they do it. If we know this, we can design our products accordingly.</p>
<p>To be able to do research on the »how« and »why« of user’s work, you need to find some users who would like to answer your questions and would show you what they do. These users are our (research) participants. (Your participants may be called your »sample«, in contrast to all those who could be possibly be participants, the »population«. So a sample – some users – is a part of the population – all possible users)</p>
<h2 id="who-are-possible-participants"><a href="#who-are-possible-participants">Who are possible participants?</a></h2>
<p>The participants in your research need to be similar to the future users of your final product. If you plan to create an app for people to create bibliographies it makes sense that the participants are students or researchers. If you plan to design a skateboard try to find people who skate. The point is: you need to make up your mind who might give you the information about the how and why of the activities you want to support with your product.</p>
<p>When selecting possible participants, I recommend doing a check based on (assumed) user behavior. Ask yourself: Are the people that may participate in your research likely to…</p>
<ul>
<li>…do the tasks the people do who should use your final product?</li>
<li>…have similar problems?</li>
<li>…have similar motivations?</li>
</ul>
<p>I assume that you don't have the money to employ a recruiting agency to get your participants. Thus you will need to find and ask them yourself. Especially if you are on your own you may need to compromise and do research with participants that don't match your intended users exactly. When doing this, keep in mind to check for similarity of tasks, problems and motivations. These checks don't ensure that the participants are exactly the ones who may use your final product. But you can be rather sure that they can tell you something that is of interest for you.</p>
<p>If you design an app for people to create bibliographies and you can only get some bachelor and masters students, but no professors, your results will still reveal a lot about the processes of creating bibliographies. Assuming that the student’s motivation is probably writing final term papers and that the professors would write journal papers is a possible difference but as long as you aware of it, you are probably o.k., but if you want to design a skateboard and the only participants you can get are all elderly people who enjoy hiking, you are in trouble; if you find elderly people who enjoy skating, go for it.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-find-participants"><a href="#how-can-i-find-participants">How can I find participants?</a></h2>
<p>Think of methods to make possible participants aware of your research and the possibility to participate. For example, participants could be found among</p>
<ul>
<li>employees of other departments</li>
<li>friends and family</li>
<li>the people who see your posts on social media</li>
<li>the people who visit your or your companies homepage</li>
<li>participants of meetings/gatherings.</li>
</ul>
<p>To find the right participants for your research, try to find out where those people are: users of a particular software can be found on mailing lists, forums and user meetings or events. Young adults could be found via bulletin boards on on university or college campus. Retired people may be found in church congregation and retirement homes.</p>
<p>Inform possible participants about the study and what they can expect when they participate. Regardless of how you inform them – if by speaking directly to them, by using a note on a blackboard or by writing an eMail – you should give them the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>the purpose of the study and the resulting benefits for the participant or the wider community (e.g. a product which is more suitable to their needs)</li>
<li>the research method (answering questions and observation)</li>
<li>the time frame (ranging usually from 30min-2h)</li>
<li>incentives (if you can afford it)</li>
<li>your contact information</li>
</ul>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Are you a designer?</strong></p>
<p>We, a team of students of the Weimar University, want to improve the free layout program frame drawer and want the application to match your workflow and needs. Therefore we would like to gather some insights in the way you work.</p>
<p>If you would like to support us, someone from our team would visit your workplace and ask you some questions and look over your shoulder while you work. This would take approximately 1h.</p>
<p>All participants get a $10 voucher for the university's cafeteria. If you would like to participate (or have further questions) please write a mail to jan.dittrich@example.com</p>
</div>
<p>When you reach out to communities for recruiting be sure to comply to the rules of the organizations or social groups involved. It does not help your research if the community you target gets upset with you for violating their privacy and customs. If you are unsure, just ask. These people you ask, lets say a clergyman or a meetup organizer may even be able to set you up with people who can help you. Once you started your research you can ask participants if they know other people who match your ideas of possible participants. It is likely that they know some other people who work in the same job or have similar hobbies. (In the literature this is also called »Snowball sampling«)</p>
<h2 id="how-many-participants-do-i-need"><a href="#how-many-participants-do-i-need">How many participants do I need?</a></h2>
<p>When estimating how many participants you need, consider how many resources (time and/or money) you can spend on doing the research. Each additional participant gives you additional data and a broader view on your possible users. However, each research session needs time do and adds to the amount of data to be analyzed – so plan accordingly.</p>
<p>You may think that more is better and that you just could shorten each session, ask fewer questions and skip observing the participants. However, if we want to find out about the »how« and »why« of the participants’ work we need time, and several sessions in hurry will lead to less useful results than research with one participant done right. Nevertheless, only doing research on very few users will restrict the variance of data – like noticing that there may be several ways to do the same thing. As well you might not see which patterns are consistent among several people and which vary – which would certainly be impossible if you only had one participant.</p>
<p>There are no clear cut rules of how many participants are enough. However, most of my projects have between 3 and 8 participants. If I really need to be sure that what I notice is consistent I'd do research with 10, but that is about the limit I can manage on my own.</p>
<p>An efficient way of involving the »right« amount of participants is doing your research iteratively: start with three or four participants and begin with the analysis as soon as possible. Steps like writing your comments to the data or even starting to create possible grouping is possible after having the data of at least two participants. Take a look at the first (preliminary) findings: Are the patterns repeating themselves and are they consistent between participants and situations? Or do they vary widely? If they are consistent, you may do research with few additional participants to refine and check and to explore details – or, if time is up, leave it the way it is.</p>
<p>If preliminary findings vary and it is hard to see any patterns you may need to involve more participants.</p>
<p>Reasons for the lack of patters in the data can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your research encompasses different groups of people with different needs – For example the groups students and professors share some traits, but many characteristics will vary.</li>
<li>The topic of your research is too broad – for example, »How do people do design« is very broad, »How do interface designers involve specifications of user research and engineers in their designs« is more specific.</li>
<li>Even if your research is focused and there is only one group of people involved, the actual patterns just vary.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all these cases you can involve more participants. Before you do involve more participants try to check if you…</p>
<ul>
<li>need to clarify your research topic (to focus your efforts)</li>
<li>need to specify the involved groups (to recruit the right participants)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="prepare-the-research-session"><a href="#prepare-the-research-session">Prepare the research session</a></h1>
<h2 id="questiontopics"><a href="#questiontopics">What do you want to find out?</a></h2>
<p>Before you collect the data, decide what you want to find out. Let’s look at some topics that might be of interest exploring:</p>
<p>I usually have three aspects I think of when I prepare my questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Activities, things the user does</li>
<li>Motivations, what the user wants to archive, what is important for him/her</li>
<li>Problems: things that interfere with the users activities and motivations</li>
</ol>
<p>There could be many other aspects, but I find these three good because</p>
<ul>
<li>they cover a wide range of possible topics questions</li>
<li>they cover design relevant topics</li>
<li>three points are easy enough to remember even in the midst of research.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me show you the questions I came up with for finding out about the needs of designers who create layouts.</p>
<h4 id="activities"><a href="#activities">Activities</a></h4>
<div class="example">
<ul>
<li>Can you describe the task you are currently working on?</li>
<li>Can you show me how you create a graphic/layout?</li>
<li>Can you show me how you use the application?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Talking about activities or observing them is a very rich source of information. When asking about activities you can often use follow up questions to find out why and how users do what they do: <em>»You said, you apply paragraph styles. What do they do?«</em> or <em>»You just used that ›align‹ function – before, you placed objects manually. What is the difference between those activities?.«</em></p>
<h4 id="motivations"><a href="#motivations">Motivations</a></h4>
<div class="example">
<ul>
<li>Can you describe the worst experience in your day so far?</li>
<li>Can you describe the best experience in your day so far?</li>
<li>Which tasks in your job do you like the least?</li>
<li>Which tasks in your job do you like the most?</li>
<li>Can you show me a piece of work you are proud of?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Questions about Motivations are usually about emotions and often their relation to activities as well. You can explore these relations further in follow-up questions ( »You said you hate talking with this client. What in particular makes it a bad experience for you?« )</p>
<h4 id="problems"><a href="#problems">Problems</a></h4>
<div class="example">
<ul>
<li>When do you feel hindered or slowed down?</li>
<li>Can you show me how you circumvent this from happening?</li>
<li>What will happen if you can’t solve this problem?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Asking for problems provides some good starting points for designing (as you can try to avoid the problems with a better solution).</p>
<p>Problems are easily communicated and the need for a solution is often very clear. Thus they provide a good starting point when convincing others …</p>
<ul>
<li>…that changes to a product/concept need to be made</li>
<li>…that your research makes sense and helps to avoid such problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, only dealing with problems would lead to pathching exisitng solutions. If you want to create new ways of approaching things, you need to connect problems to the underlying motivations by asking for the difficulties a problem causes.</p>
<p>Naturally, the three general aspects of activities, motivations and problems are just giving you a starting point for developing your questions. Use them to create questions suitable for your own research.</p>
<p>When you have started with gathering data you can further refine your questions. You will get new ideas or want to refine questions since you tried them and may notice shortcomings or opportunities.</p>
<p>For example, in the research on graphic design I noticed that idea generation during work was important for the participants and an interesting topic to research. Thus, I added questions like »How do you generate new ideas?« or »How do you know if an idea you have works?«.</p>
<p>Note that I did not ask directly »Do you generate ideas while implementing designs?«. This would be a question that urges to be answered with »yes« or »no«. Such short answers do not yield the context we need, the reasons for actions and the course of events to know not only how work is done but why it is done.</p>
<p>In later sections we will have a further look at the do's and dont’s of questions.</p>
<h2 id="write-a-cheat-sheet"><a href="#write-a-cheat-sheet">Write a cheat sheet</a></h2>
<p>You should ensure that questions you prepare are still on your mind when doing the interview. A good way to ensure this is to taking a cheat sheet (more formally also called »Interview Guide«) along.</p>
<p>What goes into such a sheet? The biggest part will be <strong>questions</strong> which you created beforehand (take a look at <a href="#questiontopics">»What do you want to find out?«</a> for collecting possible questions). When you write the questions on the cheat sheet, start with the general topics and progress towards more specific ones. This is the order that makes sense in the course of a research session. Nevertheless, that order is only a helpful guess. You will usually deviate a bit (or a lot) from your cheat sheet.</p>
<p>Often I include some kind of <strong>checklist</strong> on the top, especially if there are legal matters involved, such as signing a consent form. Thus I can tick off what we already dealt with and immediately see if I forgot something.</p>
<p>As a beginner you may have some difficulties with formulating your questions without preparations when spontaneously entering on a new subject that happens to emerge in the research session.</p>
<p>In this case you can help yourself along with some reminders on the sheet, like »Activities/Motivations/Problems«, »How and Why«, or, for the graphics design topic: »creativity/variations/creative rules/technology« or the like.</p>
<h2 id="equipment"><a href="#equipment">Equipment</a></h2>
<p>With a participant talks about new and interesting things you want to be able to remember what was said. Thus we record the interview – and we will need some equipment for doing that:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/interviewEquipment.svg" alt="Equipment for user research: paper, pen, audio recorder" /><figcaption>Equipment for user research: paper, pen, audio recorder</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li>for note taking and sketching
<ul>
<li>Paper, lined or blank (15 or more sheets, just to be on the save side)</li>
<li>Pencil or Pen (Don't forget to bring backups!)</li>
<li>Something to write on. A clipboard is great.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Audio Recording
<ul>
<li>audio recorder or smartphone</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Photos and video
<ul>
<li>a digital camera</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<!-- 
### Audio Recording  



If you audio-record you interview you have a backup in case you could not keep
up with taking notes and to be able to fully concentrate on the
participant if needed. To do an audio recording, either use your smartphone and an audio 
recording app or use an audio recorder. Test, if the audio on the recording 
is still loud and clear enough if you have an arm’s length between you and the device. 
Charge the batteries fully so you don’t run out of battery in the midst of research. -->

<h3 id="camera"><a href="#camera">Camera</a></h3>
<p>A camera is not a must but can be useful, especially if your research involves much participant observation or if you don’t feel confident about your sketching skills. --&gt;</p>
<h1 id="data-gathering"><a href="#data-gathering">Data Gathering</a></h1>
<p>In this chapter we will learn how to gather data to get to know about the activities, motivations and problems of our research participants.</p>
<p>Contrary to a common misconception of user need research, our inquiry will not be (directly) about future ideas and design – we are will not ask »do you think that a [gadget] would help you?«. yes, you <em>could</em> ask whether a particular thing would be a great to have in the future. But then you<br />would have to ask again for the next idea you have. Furthermore, it is very hard to reliably guess if something would be a great thing to have in the future. Instead of dealing with ideas directly we will find out about the how and why of our participant’s activities and thus set a reliable foundation for our designs.</p>
<p>Think of your participants as competent in what they do: they are experts in their fields and in their daily work</p>
<p>Emphazing the expertise of the participants is contrary to the idea of designers and programmers as people who improve the lives of those who »don’t get it«. Instead of this, we assume that the participants of our research have a reason of doing their work the way they do it. We try to find out these reasons behind their activities.</p>
<p>Getting to know the »how« and »why« of the users actions will allow us to evaluate our ideas (does it match their ideas of good work?) and to get inspiration for new ideas (how can we support this motivation?)</p>
<h2 id="inform-and-get-consent"><a href="#inform-and-get-consent">Inform and get Consent</a></h2>
<p>When you have found a participant, a place, a time and have your equipment ready we can start with the actual research session.</p>
<p>It is pretty straight forward: be friendly. If you come to their place (which is preferable, since you can observe the actual context) be a nice guest; if they come to your place or you meet in some »neutral space«, be a nice host.</p>
<p>Greet the participant and thank for his/her time:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Hello Lisa, great to meet you. I’m pleased, that you could free some time for showing and telling me how you work.</p>
</div>
<p>You may sprinkle in a bit of smalltalk:</p>
<div class="example">
Did you have a good start into the day?
</div>
<p>Participants should at least roughly know what the research is about. You don't need to reveal all your questions and topics but the general topic should be described</p>
<div class="example">
<p>This research helps us to improve the workflow in the design process to design solutions for people who do graphic design.</p>
</div>
<p>Make clear that you are here to learn – and not an evaluator of the quality of the participant’s work.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>…Therefore we'd like to get to know how you work. You are an expert in that field and we'd like to learn from you. This is not some kind of test – when I ask questions there are no wrong answers</p>
</div>
<p>Although you may have described the timeframe and the method already when recruiting, tell the participant what you are going to do</p>
<div class="example">
<p>We will have a conversation about your work and I'll be asking some questions. In addition, I’m interested in watching you when you do your work. The whole process will take about an hour of time.</p>
</div>
<p>The participant must know how you record data and who will see it. So tell the Participant:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>I'd like to take notes, and, in addition, record audio – if that is ok with you. The audio recording helps me to focus on your work as I don’t need to concentrate as much on writing notes, if I have the recording as backup. Me and a colleague will listen to the audio; we will anonymize and transcribe the data before we share it with the product design team.</p>
<p>If you feel uncomfortable with being recorded at any time we can pause the recording.</p>
<p>You can cancel the interview at any time if you feel it is needed.</p>
</div>
<p>I had rarely someone who did not agree to being recorded. If that happens you can ask if they have any specific worries – possibly you can inform them about that specific aspect and they might agree when they have additional information.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>[Example from an in-house research project] »Audio recording… I’m not sure about this…« »Thats fine with me. Though, may I ask what worries are?« »Hmm…yeah, I don't like, you know, human resources to get that data«</p>
<p>»I understand your concern. It is fine if you don't agree but I can assure you that Human Resources is a separate section. We don't share personal data and what we record today is not accessible to them. Also, all data that leaves my computer or the one of my colleague is being anonymized and we remove all data that points to you as person, including names, workplace and so on.</p>
</div>
<p>If they don’t agree, just stick with writing notes.</p>
<p>Consider summarizing the information about the research and the use of the participant's data in a consent form that the user signs. In this case keep the signed form, but hand the participant a copy of the form. Thus the agreement is clear for both sides. See in the Appendix for an <a href="#consentForm">example of such a form</a>.</p>
<p>When you got the consent of the participant you can start the research session.</p>
<h2 id="modes-of-gathering-data"><a href="#modes-of-gathering-data">Modes of gathering data</a></h2>
<h3 id="getting-answers"><a href="#getting-answers">Getting answers</a></h3>
<!-- Gathering information by listening to the participant’s answers is similar to  a
conversation: You ask questions, the user answered them. --> 



<p>We gather data by asking questions and listening to the participant’s answers. However, the use of questions and answers in user needfinding is unlike the questions and answers in surveys. In surveys it is often aimed for short, definitive answers out of a determined set of possibilities (»on a 4 point scale: how much do you agree with…«). Instead of this, we aim for longer answers that are give »free« and not from a determined set of answers. Thus we are more likely to get rich descriptions, much like veritable stories which retell the participant’s experiences. In addition, these stories tell us about the context of the user’s activities and the user’s motivations. To encourage giving such story like answers, we will often ask for <em>descriptions</em> of activities and the <em>reasons</em> for doing them.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>»can you describe me how you decided to use this layout?«</p>
<p>»You said that you need to look that color model up. Why?«</p>
</div>
<p>Asking questions and getting answers form a participant is a very versatile tool. It can be done without many resources. You are not tied to a specific place and you can talk about past events as well as future plans.</p>
<p>But because of this it can happen that you hardly focus on actual occurrences and experiences. Observations are thus a good supplement to asking questions and listening, since observations are naturally concernd with actual actions you can see happening at the very moment.</p>
<h3 id="observation"><a href="#observation">Observation</a></h3>
<p>What Participants describe is not always the ideal way to convey the information. Just like a picture can be worth a thousand words, it makes often sense to just ask participants to show what they mean and to demonstrate how they work.</p>
<p>Often it is easier for a research participant to just do what they do anyway instead of verbalizing it. It generates more information for you as well. It is more vivid, and the potentially distorting step of translating a process into a description is no longer required. When you observe, you will even notice things your participants would never consider mentioning: It may have become second nature for them which tools they use, how they apply these tools to their work and which problems they meet. As well, you may notice interesting properties of the context like means of communicating with co-workers or cues in the environment that point out problems – for example quick fixes with tape, or added instructions on devices and machines.</p>
<p>It is not needed to have observation as a separate step in the research process. It makes great sense to interweave it with asking questions and listening to the user. Instead asking for descriptions of processes or tool, you can ask for a demonstration.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Participant: »So I got this image and now I would try to get a suitable crop for that flyer«</p>
<p>Researcher: »Can you show me how you do it?«</p>
</div>
<p>Think of yourself as an apprentice of the participant. The participant is the master or expert who can teach you some of his/her skills. This means that understanding the user by observing is not a passive process. Like an apprentice you can and should ask questions.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Ask about reasons: »You drew that object and changed it size, then you deleted it again… what was the reason behind this?</p>
<p>Ask about things you notice in the environment: »Can you tell me what these markings are for?«</p>
</div>
<p>Teaching an apprentice is not a theoretical or artificially set up process:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The tasks you observe should be tasks the participant is actually doing (and not something set up for you):</p>
<p>Participant: »What should I do now?«</p>
<p>You: »What would you do if I would not be here?«</p>
<p>Naturally they should be relevant to your interests as well:</p>
<p>[continuing the conversation above] Participant: »I would either crop this bunch of images or I'd try to find a suitable font for the headlines in this document</p>
<p>You: »If the tasks are equally relevant to you I'd be more interested in watching you choosing the fonts«</p>
</div>
<p>Avoid positioning yourself as the expert in the participant’s domain by suggesting procedures and by telling the participant how and why something should be done. If the participant would just look up to you and your concept of how work should be done we would not get to know anything.</p>

<h2 id="building-trust"><a href="#building-trust">Building trust</a></h2>
<p>In this section I demonstrate how you can show that you value the participant’s time and input and make the participant feel comfortable during the research.</p>
<p>User researchers ask lots of possibly awkward feeling questions and at least in the beginning, a research session could be unusual for some participants. In this section we are going to look at some ways to ensure that the research session will be a pleasant experience.</p>
<h3 id="start-with-simple-questions"><a href="#start-with-simple-questions">Start with simple questions</a></h3>
<p>Start simple with some demographical questions – like like: <em>»Lets start with some simple questions about your job«</em>. You could ask <em>»What is your job title«</em> and maybe follow <em>»How do you name your Job when friends ask you what you do?«.</em> As well it might be interesting how experienced the person is: <em>»How long have you been working in your current occupation?«</em> These examples are tied to work related studies – for doing research on university students I tie the questions to their particular context and ask for example how long they have been studying so far.</p>
<p>A very obvious advantage of these questions is that they will help you to get to know some context of the participant’s work. But there is another advantage: Such questions like asking for the job title or years in the job etc. are easy to answer and it is a pretty clear how to answer to them. This gets the participants into the mode of answering questions and opening up towards you. After a brief section with these easy-to-answer questions you can transition into more open questions.</p>
<h3 id="affirm-that-you-listen"><a href="#affirm-that-you-listen">Affirm that you listen</a></h3>
<p>You will ask questions aiming for descriptions and longer answers. So you will be listening to the participant most of the time. You probably have some ways to intuitively show that you listen – like nodding with the head or saying »yes« or »mm-mhh«. This is an important way to ensure the participant that his/her information is listened to and valued.</p>
<p>However, when giving this kind of feedback you should be careful though not to skew the answers by indicating that some information is better than other. If you throw in a »yes, great« combined with nodding (as if you prefer what the participant did in comparison to something else) or if you just make a rather unmotivated »mm« and frown (as if what is told does not match your expectations) the participant will get selective about his/her answers and focus on stuff you seem to like. Try to keep the reassuring sounds or gestures neutral towards the information you get.</p>
<p>Same goes for longer intersections at the end of an answer. Intuitively you may say:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>»It was great to hear that you exchange files by mail!« (Since you may have already thought of a feature that might be helpful in that case)</p>
</div>
<p>But the participant will try to be a nice person him/herself and probably try to make you happy by going on about the problems with files in mails even though sending files per mail is possibly not that bad in the participant’s view. Instead of reassuring the participant using judgments and emotions, focus on the fact that you got information you that helps you:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>»That was interesting to hear –«</p>
</div>
<p>Possibly you could even wrap the information up »So you…« and/or refer to an area you like further information about. So it will be clear that you care for the information and listened well – without casting some judgment on what was told to you.</p>
<h3 id="body-language"><a href="#body-language">Body Language</a></h3>
<p>Make a friendly impression by using body language. Probably you would not make a bad impression anyway, but let’s go through it nevertheless: Don't give an angry or stern impression by frowning and crossing arms and legs. Don't look careless by leaning back and looking to the ceiling. During the interview, show reactions to what the participants says or does and look him/her in the eyes (at least for members of western culture). When taking notes, maintaining eye contact is not possible all the time – but keep eye contact when you can.</p>

</figure>
<h3 id="just-ask"><a href="#just-ask">Just ask</a></h3>
<p>Even if you got the consent to audio record and make photos or video ask, before you start the recording.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>»I'd start the recording, if thats o.k.« (go ahead if there are no objections)</p>
<p>»May I take a picture?«</p>
</div>
<p>Usually I fade out the length of these questions once the participant agreed, so the next time I'm photographing and I see no obvious obstacles (an obstacle might be a blueprint for a project under construction on screen or desk or anything else that is more confidential than what one would usually expect), I go with »May I…« the next time and fade out asking each time. Ask not only for recording activities – it goes for all other activities of yours you feel unsure about: just ask. By that, you show respect and care for the participant and you avoid awkward situations.</p>
<h2 id="asking-open-questions"><a href="#asking-open-questions">Asking open questions</a></h2>
<p>You may have noticed that the suggested questions from the previous section are not aiming for specific, short answers. In situations different from user need research you often want answers to be short and precise: »Are you a graphic designer?« »I am a Graphic Designer!« / »How much do you like your Job? Give a mark« »B!« / »Please name your Tools!« »InDesign, Photoshop«.</p>
<p>If you would diagram who speaks for how long when we ask for specific information with a »closed« range of possibilities, it would look like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/talkDiagram_closed.svg" alt="short closed questions" /><figcaption>short closed questions</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These questions demand very specific answers mostly out of a determined set: Yes or no, marks from A-F, a list of nouns. They would be useful if you would want to do statistics, for analysis that allows us to give results like »56.3% agreed strongly on Question X«. However, we want to find out about the <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> of the participant’s work here <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Imagine, in contrast to the research session outlined above (short answers, short questions) a day-to-day situation, in which you get to know about somebody else’s experiences: A conversation with a friend. In such an exchange you will tell each other about your experiences, what you felt, why you did this and that etc. In a diagram it would look like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/talkDiagram_friend.svg" alt="giving longer answers, equal share" /><figcaption>giving longer answers, equal share</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In contrast to a conversation, our main goal is to collect data; we don’t want to tell about our Job as a user researcher, but mostly hear answers from the participant. Thus asking questions and getting answers in a user needs research session look like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/talkDiagram_open.svg" alt="participant gives long answers, researcher asks short, open questions" /><figcaption>participant gives long answers, researcher asks short, open questions</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The questions we want to ask should encourage answers which describe experiences and give some insight into the »why« and »how« of the users activities and motivations. This type of question is called »open question« since these questions don’t have a determined set of answers.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Open questions would be: <em>&quot;Describe how you started your work today&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;Why did you copy that page?&quot;</em></p>
</div>
<p>Using such open questions encourage telling longer, story-like answers. These answers will even contain information you did not expect to get.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>A participant is describing me the printing process: <em>»…then I look up which color specification the printery needs…«</em> That is a new step in the workflow I did not expect (Naively, I thought that you just send the document to the printery like you would when you print it on your desktop printer – have a file, print it). Thus I discovered a step in the workflow and a potential field of work (taking care of color spaces and profiles) of which I did not know that it even exists!</p>
</div>
<p>The information you get will not be abstract as in answers like »good« or »I dislike it« but tied to a situation. This is preferable, because a future product will be used in real situations and not in an abstract space of thought.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>»I like it when the feedback [to the design] comes quickly. No annoying waiting… it always makes me nervous. Do they [the client] like it or do I need to throw out work?« – this tells us more about the situation than a client’s feedback being just described as »good«.</p>
</div>
<p>If you look back to the questions already mentioned, they will share some characteristics.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Here are some possible questions</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you describe the worst experience in your day so far?</li>
<li>Can you tell me how you create a layout?</li>
<li>Can you tell me what makes a client »difficult«</li>
<li>Can you describe how do you get new ideas?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>All these questions start with »…can you describe« or »…can you tell me«, which encourages a longer answer (»describing« or »telling« is something needs usually more than one word). In addition, all sentences contain a <em>Why-</em>, <em>What-</em> or <em>How-</em>. These question words, again, suggest an elaborate answer, not just one or two words.</p>
<p>Thus, a template for such questions would look like <em>»tell me [how/why/what] + interest</em></p>
<p>Contrast this with questions like</p>
<div class="example">
<p>You: »Is this a good design?«</p>
<p>Participant: »yes!«</p>
</div>
<p>»Is…« -questions will be answered with »yes« or »no« – but we don't get to know why the participant to agrees or disagrees with our assumption. In addition, »Is…«-Questions are a subtle form or influence <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> : In case of doubt it is likely that are participant just agrees to the suggestion you give by asking »Is…«</p>
<p>Sometimes, »Is«-Questions will come in a disguised form – as an addition which is made to an open question:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>You: »Can you tell me how you solve this problem? …Do you do it by just calling the client and resolving the issue?«</p>
<p>Participant: »Yes, I do«</p>
<p>Please note that the question did not contain the word »is«, but follows the same pattern of asking for a binary »yes« or »no« response.</p>
</div>
<p>Avoiding closed questions is actually harder than one thinks. We intuitively try to make answering easier with such additions like »Do you […]«.</p>
<p>When you create your questions check if they demand some predetermined outcomes – if the do, they are closed questions. In this case reformulate the questions in a way that allows non-restricted, story-like answers.</p>
<h2 id="overcoming-problems"><a href="#overcoming-problems">Overcoming problems</a></h2>
<p>There are some problems that are likely to arise when you gather data. Knowing the problems and some ways of dealing with them will help you.</p>
<h3 id="be-aware-of-your-influence"><a href="#be-aware-of-your-influence">Be aware of your influence</a></h3>
<p>A very obvious problem is influencing the participant. One way to minimize this would be making all research sessions alike – just like you would do when using a standardized questionnaire. But doing this you would loose the very strengths of the methods described here: Being able to find out about new and unexpected things and reacting to them and gaining some understanding of the »how« and »why« by asking questions and looking for cues depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Each participant and his/her context is different and you can accommodate this by adjusting the research session to the context and the activities of the user. This would not be possible when asking the same questions each time.</p>
<p>So you neither can’t nor should take yourself out of the research session – you will always have some sort of effect on the participant when you do the research.</p>
<p>What you should avoid though is influencing the participant by »suggesting« favorable answers or actions. Some sorts of this type of influence are obvious, others are not.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>»This is good, isn’t it?!«</p>
</div>
<p>Is a very obvious influence, since it blatantly states what you think the answer should be: A »yes«.</p>
<p>There are less obvious influences as well:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>»Would you like a better version of this with a big button here?«</p>
</div>
<p>In this example, a positive word (»better«) and a suggestion go together. Who would not like an improvement?! A »yes« is guaranteed – as well as a meaningless finding which would be »people want improvements«.</p>
<p>Aside from your questions you could influence the user with your feedback since it might suggest that there are »good« and »bad« answers. For example, it may be tempting to correct users and show the »right way« of doing something:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>If you know that there is a »change color« function in the application and the user says: »Well; I am annoyed by that application – I'd like to change the colors but they are fixed!« It may be tempting to say: »No, you can change it!«</p>
</div>
<p>Remember that you want to find out what your participant does and why. To correct the participant is not very useful. Use the possibility to further explore the topic without correcting the user <a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> .</p>
<div class="example">
<p>You could just ask »what's the reason for you doing it this way«, or, if talking about the function itself is really important to you, you could ask »How did you expect to do the color change if there would be such a function?«</p>
</div>
<p>Similarly, you could be surprised or even annoyed by steps or actions in a workflow of the user which seem outright superfluous.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>»When I write a text I write a draft and then send it to my colleague via mail as an attached .doc file. My colleague comments on it and returns the mail to me« You may think that this is rather inefficient. You could be tempted to say »Why don't you paste the text in the mail and comment directly? Or write it live on Etherpad? This would be far quicker!«</p>
</div>
<p>Remember that nobody does inefficient things by purpose. Assume that the user has a reason. Try to find out what this reason may be.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Again you could ask: »what's the reason for you doing it this way« – and remember to ask follow-up question to further explore the issue.</p>
</div>
<p>Your influencing feedback could be non-verbal as well. Like in everyday conversations you may shrug or frown if you disagree with an utterance or an action. Even if you don’t say »this is wrong«, frowning or shaking your head may have the same results.</p>
<p>So: don’t be afraid to react towards the participant – reacting towards the participant is essential in our research. But don’t suggest »good« or »bad« answers or »good« or »bad« ways of doing things by using words, gestures or facial expressions.</p>
<h3 id="silence-feels-strange-but-is-o.k."><a href="#silence-feels-strange-but-is-o.k.">Silence feels strange but is o.k.</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes, the participant will take time to think before answering. Intuitively, you may want to fill the silence to help the participant along.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>»Can you describe me what happened after you were finished with creating the print-ready-file? [1 sec] Was it all well?« »yeah, sort of well I think«</p>
</div>
<p>It is tempting to fill the silence with suggestions for the answer. But it can skew the answers and can turn a open question (»can you describe…?«) into a closed question (»can you describe… was it…?« /»yes«).</p>
<p>Try to tolerate the silence. Usually, the participant will answer within a few seconds. If you notice silence which you want to fill, count to 3 or 5 before probing further. When the set time is up, you can ask about the question rather than giving suggestions, like</p>
<div class="example">
<p>What makes the question hard to answer?</p>
</div>
<p>Or</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Can you tell me what you are thinking about?</p>
</div>
<p>If the participant has started to give an answer already but stops talking and makes a longer pause and you still like to know more, you could »echo« the most recent statement or words the participant has said.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Participant: »So I had it finished and send it away to the client and then almost nothing… [Pause]«</p>
<p>Researcher: »almost nothing?«</p>
</div>
<p>This is a technique to make people carry on without skewing their answer.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Researcher:»almost nothing?«</p>
<p>Participant: »Yes, there was a brief mail that they got the design but I was unsure if that person actually gave it to the people who can decide something. That waiting just sucks.«</p>
</div>
<h3 id="keep-your-questions-simple"><a href="#keep-your-questions-simple">Keep your questions simple</a></h3>
<p>Questions should be simple to understand and only one question should be asked at once.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Can you describe how you align these elements? What is good about the resulting design?</p>
</div>
<p>The question asks two things at once. This is has some disadvantages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It confuses the interviewee – what should be answered first?</li>
<li>Both, Interviewer and Interviewee need to remember both questions while talking and listening</li>
</ol>
<p>So, one question should be asked at once. In the example above one question should be asked first, then the second:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>»Can you describe how you align these elements?« [Answer]</p>
<p>»What is good about the resulting design? « [Answer]</p>
</div>
<h2 id="dont-make-the-user-the-designer"><a href="#dont-make-the-user-the-designer">Don't make the user the designer</a></h2>
<p>It is tempting to skip investigating the »how« and »why« of the participant’s work and to ask the participant instead directly<br />how the final product should be like</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Which function do you need for aligning objects?</p>
</div>
<p>This is basically asking the user for the design of the software.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Yes, there should be a button for, like equal distributions… here. It should be easy, so it should have a button with a ›distr‹ on it in red, so I don’t oversee it…</p>
</div>
<p>Asking the user for a design sounds like a reasonable thing to do – the resulting designs would be directly based on the suggestions of the participant.</p>
<p>But it usually leads to disastrous results. Even for experienced designers it may be hard to come up with a good interface which is easy to learn and efficient to use. And even experienced designers take time, often creating multiple versions which are then tested. How should somebody inexperienced in that task come up with a great interface spontaneously?</p>
<p>Another (highly tempting) way of »making the participant the designer« is to ask for the usefulness of hypothetical functions that you fancy yourself:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Would a function for choosing a color scheme help you?</p>
</div>
<p>This is like asking »Do you want an additional tool which might be useful at some point and get it for free?«. If the participant can think of a few occasions in which such a tool <em>might</em> be useful, the answer will be »yes«. In addition,nothing can be found out about the »how« and »why« of the participant's work – just like with other questions that ask for »yes« or »no« outcomes.</p>
<p>If you <em>really</em> want to discuss a function instead of focusing on what the participant does and why this is done, give some context to the question and tie it to a specific situation.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>We think of a system in which colors can be changed like you just changed the paragraph-styles. How would such a feature be relevant or not in the task you just described?</p>
</div>
<p>Thus, you can get more information on the tasks for which the feature could be useful. The question is not tied to all possible situations but to a specific one.</p>
<p>Asking the user for design ideas and functions is tempting but rarely useful. If possible, avoid it and concentrate on the finding about how and why they work the way they do. If you really need to ask for designs or function ideas, tie them to a specific context and ask for descriptive answers instead of asking if something in general might be good or not.</p>
<h2 id="referring-back"><a href="#referring-back">Referring back</a></h2>
<p>In this section I will demonstrate how to maintain flow and elicit further information by referring to previous answers or demonstrations.</p>
<h3 id="referring-back-for-further-elaboration"><a href="#referring-back-for-further-elaboration">Referring back for further elaboration</a></h3>
<figure>
<img src="images/talkDiagram_ReferBackDirect.svg" alt="continue with same topic by referring back to someting just said" /><figcaption>continue with same topic by referring back to someting just said</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A typical use of that method is asking for further information on something that was mentioned and which interests you in particular. In this case, refer back to the information and ask for elaboration.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>That typography settings – you said they are far more precise than the ones in wordprocessors. Can you explain me how these differences help you to design compared to the ones in wordprocessors?</p>
</div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="example">
<p>You said that you would continue with setting up the ›masterpage‹. Can you show me how?</p>
</div>
<h3 id="referring-back-for-further-elaboration-1"><a href="#referring-back-for-further-elaboration-1">Referring back for further elaboration</a></h3>
<figure>
<img src="images/talkDiagram_ReferBackDistance.svg" alt="change the topic by referring to something said some time ago" /><figcaption>change the topic by referring to something said some time ago</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can refer back to the answer which was just given and continue with the same topic. But referring back can be used as well to provide a transition between <em>different</em> topics. This is especially useful if the participant is talking about something that deviates much from what you are interested in. By referring to something previously mentioned or demonstrated you can show that you have been attentive and thus make the topic change less intrusive:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>»…so this was a design made by some artist. It was really wired, I shared the office with him for some time. He always came with that dog of him which…« »Hmm…you previously talked about creating a cover for the book – you said that you try several designs. Can you describe how you try them?«</p>
</div>
<h3 id="referring-back-to-check-your-understanding"><a href="#referring-back-to-check-your-understanding">Referring back to check your understanding</a></h3>
<p>You can refer back to answers to check your grasp of what the participant talked about. In this case, even closed questions are ok.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>»I saw you choose the color from that palette down there – is this the same palette you choose the background color from?« »No, it is not – the palette I am using here is…«</p>
</div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="example">
<p>»So: If I want to print something first I need to ask for their color profile, when I have this, I load it in InDesign, choose the profile in the pdf dialog and then export it?« »Yes. I usually to a test afterwards by opening the pdf in addition«</p>

<p><br /><br /> These techniques explained here involve jumping back to some previously mentioned topic. This may seem difficult, since you need to remember some particular information (to refer to it later) while carrying on with the research. However, it is not that hard – just give it a try. As well, keep in mind that you can make brief notes reminding you of things that are of interest. With a look on your note sheet they will return to your memory in case you forgot about them.</p>
<h2 id="how-exactly-would-you-do-it"><a href="#how-exactly-would-you-do-it">How exactly would you do it?</a></h2>
<p>After you ask a question, participants will sometimes answer <em>»in general«</em></p>
<div class="example">
<p>»In general, I have a workflow of these steps: Research, Ideation, Creation, Evaluation. So in research I…«</p>
</div>
<p>It may seem great – after all, a general process which you can apply to just about anything is a finding we seem want! But actually these <em>»in general«</em> descriptions pose some problems: Since they are general and thus abstract they lack a rich context and stand rather disconnected to other activities or motivations. A general principle is independent of<br />such »minor« day to day things. But these seemingly trivial informations about the context of activities give us the insights we need to find out why and how the participant is doing something in the real, particular situation. Such »general« procedures may as well be heavily idealized and rarely applied in the way they are described.</p>
<p>A way to get real-world, rich data is to ask for an example. Thus you don’t blatantly reject the »general« answer but you convey that you are interested and want to understand it better:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Can you show me an example of how you put that principles into practice?</p>
</div>
<p>You can as well ask for a specific occasion of the »general« happening or being done. The answer will be give the context of the activities happening in an actual situation.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>In the magazine project – can you describe how your design process was there?</p>
</div>
<p>Or</p>
<div class="example">
<p>»Can you show me how you do this in the project you are working on now – if that makes sense?«</p>
</div>
<p>Very often you may discover that the reality is far less consistent and far more context-depended then in the general examples. The findings are more interesting and inspiring as well:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Participant: »Well, in this project we have a tight deadline. So we needed to speed up. So I did some research… well, I reused some I did have from a similar project… and talked to a fellow student who did something similar. And then…«</p>
</div>
<p>By asking for examples and specific events instead of context-free generalizations, you can get more information and avoid doing research on »general«, possibly not actually practiced ways of work.</p>

<h2 id="wrap-it-up"><a href="#wrap-it-up">Wrap it up</a></h2>
<p>When you covered the topics you wanted to know about and explored them sufficiently by asking questions and observing it may be time to wrap up the research session.</p>
<p>I made the experience that after 30 minutes I covered the general questions. However, getting to know complex workflows takes longer. Same goes for getting deeper insights into (work) culture. As well, using observations will need some time too. So if you go beyond a simple interview you should plan 1-2h for one research session.</p>
<p>Don’t let this estimations fence you in: You will develop some intuition for the flow of the research session and how long it should take.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the research session should be comfortable for the participant. If he/she looks absent, yawns etc. it is probably time to wrap it up.</p>
<p>Before I finish I go through my cheat sheet and see if I did cover my questions. I try to summarize what I learned from the participant by going through my notes and verbalize the information. You can even announce it like this:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>This was very interesting. To wrap it up I want to give a brief summary of what I learned. Please feel free to correct me, if I misunderstood something! So: Your, you said that your work is to…</p>
</div>
<p>By verbalizing what you learned you can fill any gaps and create fade out the research session. When you finished going though your notes and giving your summary, thank the participant for taking the time. If you have any incentives or compensation, give them to the participant. In addition, I try to give an outlook on the next steps in the research. I think it is nice to let the participant know how the data matters for me:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>My next steps would be going though audio and notes. After anonymizing what we recorded, me and my colleague analyze the data and the data from other research sessions to find out how graphic designers work.</p>
<p>We will try to improve our products by making it more suitable to this workflow.</p>

<h3 id="notes"><a href="#notes">Notes</a></h3>
<figure>
<img src="images/notizenKlemmbrett.jpg" alt="making notes on a clipboard" /><figcaption>making notes on a clipboard</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>During the interview you will take brief notes. This is rather similar like taking notes in school or university: You go for the gist of what was said but you don't write down the exact words (Except in the case you find a particular expression itself important). One utterance or observation concerning one topic goes in one line.</p>
<p>You can’t just look at your note sheet and write down what the participants says without ever looking at him/her. So you need to do the notetaking in addition to observing, listening and asking.</p>
<p>If you don’t care too much about your handwriting you can write notes without much looking at the paper except for some occasional glances. In case you find something very important and fear forgetting it, you can ask the participant to repeat the utterance – but keep this to a minimum.</p>
<p>If you can, try to provide some context in your notes. If a note has some own context information attached to it, it can be understood on its own, too.</p>
<div class="example">
Rather than writing <em>»she clicks«</em> (what? Why?) you could write <em>»Clicks save button, has finished balancing the elements«</em> or the like.
</div>
<div class="example">
Rather than »creates empty page« write »creates empty pages to organize drafts«
</div>
<p>If your notes have a meaning on their own it will be far easier to analyze them later.</p>
<h3 id="audio"><a href="#audio">Audio</a></h3>
<p>Unlike making notes on paper, making an audio recording is a rather passive process except for pressing the record button.</p>
<p>I recommend using audio recordings – it is a useful supplement to your notes. It will record the audio during the research session so that you can listen to what was said hereafter. Note that it is not a perfect capture of all that happened: It records only sound, so if the participant points to the screen and refers to »this«, the recording is not much of help.</p>
<h3 id="photos"><a href="#photos">Photos</a></h3>
<p>Making photos is rather easy and can capture lots of information. For example, you can photograph the participant's desk to aid your memory. Later, you can go back and see what was on it: Paper, pens, computer; were there tidy looking stacks and containers for all the utensils? Or was it seemingly messy?</p>
<p>You can photograph the users screen if your research involves computers and gadgets. Tech savvy users may cringe since a software based screenshot is technically superior – but if the user does not know you to make a screenshot, a camera is a handy way to capture the screen.</p>
<p>You should be able to to make photos with your camera quickly and reliably. Thus, use a device you know and which has a good auto-mode. The only setting that I use beyond that is the exposure compensation in case an important part of the image totally dark or disappears in light. Exposure compensation allows adjusting for that.</p>
<p>Avoid complicated set-ups or even arranging the participant and his/her tools. Arranging the participant and his/her tools would change the data you record.</p>

<h3 id="sketches"><a href="#sketches">Sketches</a></h3>
<p>The Observations you make are, by nature, visual and concerned with processes. Make sketches or even little storyboards to capture what you see.</p>
<p>It is very useful that you can choose what to draw: highlight what is important, leave out what is irrelevant and make annotations to ease understanding the sketches later.</p>
<p>I mostly use my sketches the same way I use notes: Notes and sketches are made on a common sheet of paper; one sketched observation goes in one line, if possible</p>

</figure>
<h1 id="after-the-session"><a href="#after-the-session">After the Session</a></h1>
<p>After our research session we have our notes, sketches and possibly audio and photos. Using these recordings as well as our memory we create a coherent document for each participant which captures the research session and the recorded utterances and observations.</p>
<h2 id="supplement-from-memory"><a href="#supplement-from-memory">Supplement from memory</a></h2>
<p>It is essential to take time after the research session to supplement your notes with information from your memory. While collecting the data with the participant you will be very busy listening and thinking of following questions. So you may not be able to keep up with writing notes and drawing sketches. There is no need to worry since usually you'll remember how to fill these gaps from your memory. But you need to do it quickly. If you don’t do it right after the interview, your memory fades and the chance to supplement the information is gone.</p>
<p>To supplement your notes of the research session just go through them chronologically and add annotations.</p>
<p>A part of these additions are things that are not in the notes yet but still in my memory. In this case I <em>add</em> them, like</p>
<div class="example">

</div>
<p>or I supplement some <em>existing</em> point with additional information:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Sketching paper kept ready. [ADDITION]: <em>In transit: in the backpack; at the workplace: right on the desk</em></p>
</div>
<p>You can give brief notes more meaning by adding context from your memory:</p>
<div class="example">
<ul>
<li>She saves old ideas [ADDITION]: For later inspiration in other projects *</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="gallery four">

<figure>
<img src="images/usersketch4.png" />
</figure>
<p class="caption">
Memory fades quickly
</p>

</div>


<p>When revising your sketches, redraw the lines if the sketch is ambiguous otherwise and add annotations if you think that they might ease interpreting the sketch later on.</p>
<p>Think of your future self: Some notes may make perfect sense to you now but since memory fades, they will seem cryptic later. So supplement and clarify your sketches and notes so you can comprehend them after your memories of the experience have faded.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>I have line <em>»Big changes«</em> in my Notes. I remember that I made this note when the participant told me that her colleagues make bigger changes between to two versions of their designs than she does. I added this information to the notes, since it provided a way to understand what the »big changes« actually refer to.</p>
</div>
<p>Similarly, if my writing is rather messy, I rewrite some words to ensure that I can later decipher what I wrote.</p>
<p>I write and draw my supplements in another color than the original notes. When I wrote my notes during the interview with a blue pen I use black for the supplements or vice versa, since I like to be able to keep track of what I did in which step of the process.</p>
<div class="example">
<figure>
<img src="images/NotesSupplements2Anno.png" />
</figure>
<p>In this scanned part of a note sheet you see how the supplements are used: <strong>1)</strong> These parts have been partly rewritten in black as it was too messy before. <strong>2)</strong> At the right you see an newly drawn annotated sketch that provides a visual representation (how the document is organized by inserting empty pages). <strong>3.)</strong> More information has been provided. It was »keeping for inspiration«, now its »keeping <em>old stuff</em> for inspiration«</p>
</div>
<p>Using different colors is useful for another type of supplement: Ideas or remarks in connection to your notes. When I go through the notes I often have some ideas for a design or a question which I would like to further explore in a future interview. I write them down in a third color or I prefix the note with <em>»IDEA:«</em> or <em>»QUESTION«</em> in order to prevent myself of mixing ideas with empirical data.</p>
<p>Writing notes, drawing sketches and supplementing them hereafter will enable you to preserve information in the most situations. However, for complicated descriptions of workflows or if you just loose track by accident, it might be useful to have a backup by using audio recording.</p>
<h2 id="transcribeNotes"><a href="#transcribeNotes">transcribe notes</a></h2>
<p>When I added my supplements to the notes and sketches I usually type them in a wordprocessor document. In addition, I scan my notes, so I can easily cut and paste my sketches into the document.</p>
<p>When transcribing the notes, I take care that each line in the digital transcript has only one statement in it and not several, so that I don't tie two separate statements together. On the other hand, make sure that the data you write down is meaningful on its own and is not just a single word or a description which is free of any context and thus hard to set in relation to other data.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Not meaningful on its own (means mostly: too short):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I duplicate objects</li>
<li>making space</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is any way to add the actual context (out of the memory or using other notes) these notes should be supplemented with that context which hopefully helps us to get to know why are objects are duplicated and for which purpose is the space is made.</p>
<p><strong>Too many statements in one line (means as well: too long):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Duplicating pages to save old ideas is common. Later she goes back to the duplicates and looks at them when she needs inspiration</li>
<li>Tries to have enough space for the margins to write my comments in the margins; to do so she shrinks the main text area. I could as well try to make space down here, and use footnotes for the comments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasonable (each line can stand on its own and does not to cover multiple issues at once)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Duplicating objects to save old ideas for later inspiration</li>
<li>Make space for additional comments by shrinking main text area.</li>
<li>Alternative places for additional comments: Either right margin or bottom.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The notes from the reserach session and later added supplements from my memory are treated alike in my documents since they are all data I gathered by listening or observing the participant. But I take care that later added design ideas and research questions are still easily distinguishable from the actual data that I gathered in the research session.</p>
<h2 id="review-sketches-photos-and-audio"><a href="#review-sketches-photos-and-audio">Review Sketches, Photos and Audio</a></h2>
<h3 id="sketches-1"><a href="#sketches-1">Sketches</a></h3>
<p>Since my sketches are usually on the same sheet of paper as my notes, I review my sketches when I am transcribing the notes.</p>
<p>If it makes sense I summarize the information of the sketch in a line or two (since it is easier to work with text than with images). Otherwise, I paste the sketch from a scan into the document with the transcript.</p>
<h3 id="photos-1"><a href="#photos-1">Photos</a></h3>
<p>After the research session go through your photos just like you went through your notes. If it makes sense, you can use the information from the photos to supplement your notes. It might as well useful to summarize what one sees on the photo. These descriptions can be used more easy than the photo itself when doing the analysis.</p>
<div class="example">
<figure>
<img src="images/ObservationDesignU4ScreenFontMix.jpg" alt="photographing a screen instead of using screenshots" /><figcaption>photographing a screen instead of using screenshots</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For the photo above you might add the following line to your notes: »participant displays different font combinations in the layout application to see if the fonts go well together (see <em>U2-14-9-14_1.jpg</em> )«</p>
</div>
<h3 id="audio-1"><a href="#audio-1">Audio</a></h3>
<p>After the research session I listen to the recording. Usually I have the audio as a .mp3 and the notes as a typed out plaintext or wordprocessor document (see: <a href="#transcribeNotes">Transcribe Notes</a>, so I can open audio and transcript in parallel on my computer. When the audio contains information which is not in the document or if it supplements information that is already there, I pause the playback and write the additional information in the document. So the process is very similar to supplementing your notes from memory.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Audio recording: »…hmm I send it to my boss. She will check it. Now I go to that other document, and see…«</p>
<p>The notes say: »Send document via mail«</p>
<p>So I add the information about the cause of sending the mail: »Send document via mail to the boss for checking.«</p>
</div>
<p>If you need to save time, go through your notes and see where they lack information. Then just jump to the parts of the audio that might complement these sections.</p>
<p><br /><br /> As a result of supplementing our notes from memory and by using the audio, sketches and photos we now have a document which summerizes our reserach session. The data is mainly text-based, though if an information is better expressed via a sketch or an image paste it in the document or refer to it.</p>
<h1 id="analysis"><a href="#analysis">Analysis</a></h1>
<h2 id="why-analysis"><a href="#why-analysis">Why Analysis?</a></h2>
<p>In the analysis we will take a closer look at the data and organize it after meaningful pattern. After the interviews the data is organized by participants or the research sessions: All notes from one research session or participant are grouped together. This is a format which is hard to use for designing. At best we could pick out single data pieces and tell which participant said it.</p>
<p>What would be more useful if we would organize the data by needs of users and their problems. To do this we take the data – which is currently organized by participants – and cluster the data by meaningful themes.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/aggregationAnalysis.svg" alt="Analysis for creating themes independent from particular participants" /><figcaption>Analysis for creating themes independent from particular participants</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="organization-of-data"><a href="#organization-of-data">Organization of data</a></h2>
<p>In the analysis we organize the data hierarchically. The basis for our analysis are the utterances or observations, represented usually by a line in your transcript, like »I find it boring to move around all the textboxes again!«. These pieces of data will be grouped if they may share a similar theme. These groups get a headline, stating the theme of by the underlying pieces of data.<br />This is useful when designing, since you can refer to the headline instead of considering all the underlying data each time.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will have groups which relate to a common theme themselves. In this case it makes sense to make a group of groups and give the underlying groups of utterances and observations and their headlines an overarching headline.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Here is a part of an analyis.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Overarching theme</em>: using existing work for inspiration 
<ul>
<li><em>sub-theme</em>: review previous projects 
<ul>
<li><em>Data:</em> » have a look at an old project to see how I solved this problem…«</li>
<li><em>Data:</em> Participant searches for…</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>sub-theme</em>: use other’s work  for inspiration
<ul>
<li><em>Data:</em> »I look on google images how other calendars look like«</li>
<li><em>Data:</em> browses through the book to see…</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Such a hierarchial analysis could be done in two ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Top-Down</strong>: You first name the groups and write the headlines and than sort pieces of data into the groups hereafter</li>
<li><strong>Bottom-Up</strong>: You first group pieces of data which seem to share a similar theme and then give the group a comprehensive headline which states the topic shared by the underlying pieces of data.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are going to use mainly the 2nd way, doing a so called »bottom-up« analysis. This does not mean that we never take a piece of data and sort it into an existing group. It just means that the group names are initially created are based on actual data.</p>
<p>Thus in the analysis we may start with grouping moving similar data</p>
<div class="example">
<ul>
<li><em>Data:</em> »I look on google images how other calendars look like«</li>
<li><em>Data:</em> Browses through the book to see…</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Then we give that data a headline and name the topic:</p>
<div class="example">
<ul>
<li><strong>theme:</strong> use other’s work  for inspiration
<ul>
<li><em>Data:</em> »I look on google images how other calendars look like«</li>
<li><em>Data:</em> Browses through the book to see…</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When we come across a piece of data which shares the topic we can add it to the group too:</p>
<div class="example">
<ul>
<li><em>theme:</em> use other’s work  for inspiration
<ul>
<li><strong>Data: Searches on amazon to see how covers of books about the same topic look like</strong></li>
<li><em>Data:</em> »I look on google images how other calendars look like«</li>
<li><em>Data:</em> Browses through the book to see…</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="create-meaningful-groups"><a href="#create-meaningful-groups">Create meaningful groups</a></h2>
<p>I already talked about grouping data by shared themes. The question is: What is a meaningful theme?</p>
<p>One method to group data and derive a theme would going through the data and see which utterances and observations mention the same thing or the same assessment. Thus all notes mentioning »color« would belong to one theme and get the headline „Color“; all notes mentioning »good« belong to one theme and get the headline „good things“.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Let’s say we gathered this data (among others) in research on Do-It-Yourself-Work (DIY)</p>
<ul>
<li>The shelf looks not as neat as a bought one, but it is mine</li>
<li>When it is broken and I need to get to work I can fix my bike quickly</li>
<li>The cabinet’s door was loose. It annoyed me, so I repaired it.</li>
<li>I look at the assembled bike and think: nobody else has the same</li>
</ul>
<p>If we put the pieces of data which mention the same things in the same group we get these two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theme: Bikes I look at the assembled bike and think: nobody else has the same When my bike is broken and I need to get to work I can fix my bike quickly</li>
<li>Theme: Furniture
<ul>
<li>The cabinet’s door was loose. It annoyed me, so I repaired it. -The shelf looks not as clean as a bought one, but it is mine</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Organizing the data by this »same things mentioned«-method would help us to find data concerned with a specific thing or assessment: If we want see everything that concerned furniture we can go through the data in the »furniture« group; If we would like to know what people liked we could look it up in a group titled »good«.</p>
<p>However, the themes have no meaning on its own when organizing using the »same things mentioned«-method. You still need to go through the data points to find out what people did with their furniture and what they think of as »good«. The themes are just labels for the content.</p>
<p>Imagine we would not create the themes by looking for same things being mentioned but by the insights we drew from the data in the group by focusing on the meaning of activities, problems and goals for the participants.</p>
<p>If we take the data about DIY again this could look like this:</p>
<div class="example">
<ul>
<li>Theme/Insight: Participants need to »make things work«
<ul>
<li>The cabinet’s door was loose. It annoyed me, so I repaired it.</li>
<li>When my bike is broken and I need to get to work with it the next day I can fix my bike quickly</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Theme/Insight: Good: DIY gives sense of individuality
<ul>
<li>The shelf looks not as clean as a bought one, but it is mine</li>
<li>I look at the assembled bike and think: nobody else has the same</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>If we organize data by the insights about the participants and summarize the insight in the group’s title (the theme), this title is useful on its own: It is not just for accessing the data, it is an empirically based principle we can follow when we design.</p>
<p>If you design, let’s say, for a DIY-Online community, an insight like »DIY gives as sense of ownership« may inspire the implementation of a function which allows people to share their designs and customizations. The insight that sometimes DIY is just about fixing things may lead to the provision of a wiki for collecting best practices for doing common repairs and maintenance.</p>
<p>If you have a new idea you can ask yourself »Does this idea follow what is stated in the group titles? Does it violate it them?«. You may ask yourself »With which design could I realize this principle?«. Since the principles are based on our data, they will express the actual needs of your users and not some (potentially stereotypical) assumptions.</p>
<p>Grouping your data based on insights about your participants provides great benefits. But it can be hard and may be not possible for all your data. Creating groups using the same-things-mentioned methods is still a useful method and these groups may still evolve. Usually I have quite some »same-things-mentioned«-groups in the beginning and far fewer at the end – but still my analysis will be a mixture of both styles.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Understanding why organizing data based on insights is an important point which can be hard to grasp for beginners. I think examples can be a create help in understanding it, thus I want to provide an additional demonstration in the gist of the above mentioned DIY data. Like the DIY data this example is made up by me to be able to demonstrate the shift from same-things-mentioned to insight-based organization.</p>
<p>Let’s say we gathered this data (among others) in research with beginners in web programming:</p>
<ul>
<li>To try out stuff in HTML is fun</li>
<li>I analyze Javascript code to understand patterns</li>
<li>It is great to quickly test something using a JavaScript framework</li>
<li>To know these ›attributes‹ of HTML-›tags‹ makes writing code easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we put the pieces of data which mention the same things in the same group we get these two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theme: Utterances with HTML
<ul>
<li>To try out stuff in HTML is fun</li>
<li>To know these 'attributes' of HTML-'tags' makes writing code easier.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Theme: Utterances with JavaScript
<ul>
<li>I analyze JavaScript code to understand patterns</li>
<li>It is great to quickly test something using a JavaScript framework</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Organizing the data by the insights we may draw from the data the structure look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theme/Insight: Trying out is good
<ul>
<li>To try out stuff in HTML is fun</li>
<li>It is great to quickly test something using a javascript framework</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Theme/Insight: Learning makes own coding better
<ul>
<li>I analyze Javascript code to understand patterns</li>
<li>To know these 'attributes' of HTML-'tags' makes writing code easier.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="doing-the-right-analysis"><a href="#doing-the-right-analysis">Doing the right Analysis</a></h2>
<p>The data analysis is done by inferring themes from several data points. Thus the process is empirical (as it is based on gathered data) but if the same data is used, analysis made by different people will differ. This is because the result of the analysis depends on the reasonable but still individual and debatable interpretation of the data. You could say that »looking at last years design to quickly reuse elements« belongs to a group concerned with »I want to save time« or to one related to the topic of »reviewing designs for inspiration« (given that it could serve both from the user's perspective).</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong nor a clear cut criteria of being »close enough« to the data when you group your data in themes. Instead of having a clear, measurable rule like »you must have 0.5 significance in statistics, most important is that your analysis is plausible (instead of »right« or »wrong«).</p>
<p>I compare the process of analysis to building a house from a pile of Lego® bricks. These bricks are like the not-yet-analysed data you start with. When you build a house out of these bricks, there is no »right« building. But neither is it a process which is arbitrary.</p>
<p>There are many, many ways to stack up the bricks – but only a very few of these generally possible ways will result in something that can be plausibly called a house.</p>

<p>How your final Lego® house will look like is not determined from the beginning, rather you will change designs, move walls and sometimes try to use the same piece in different parts of the building to try out and improve. The same things will happen when you analyze data: There are many very many possible ways to just arrange the data, but only some of them will create something that is meaningful to you and others. This creation of a meaningful structure is not determined at the beginning, but a process, just like building your Lego® house, in which you trial, fail, find improvements and step by step come closer to a structure you are satisfied with.</p>
<h2 id="prepare-data-for-analysis"><a href="#prepare-data-for-analysis">Prepare Data for Analysis</a></h2>
<p>Before we start with the analysis we should prepare our data.</p>
<h3 id="add-participant-codes"><a href="#add-participant-codes">Add Participant Codes</a></h3>
<p>When you create groups of data it is good to know if the theme of the group is more or less general or only concerns one participant.</p>
<p>Thus you should supply your each datapoint (=line in the transcript) with a participant code. A participant code works like a pseudonym: The user is not identifiable by his/her real name, but by a stand-in for the name. I use neutral number codes: The first person I did a research session with is P1, the second is P2 etc.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>If you have this on your transcript:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is hard to know what exactly the client wants, because I dont talk directly to the client</li>
<li>The document is divided in sections, seperated by blank pages.</li>
<li>The current ideas/prototypes are in the first section. All discarded or “paused” ones are in later sections (the archive”) […]</li>
</ul>
<p>It will look like this after adding the participant codes (the data is from the second research session:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is hard to know what exactly the client wants, because I don’t talk directly to the client – <strong>P2</strong></li>
<li>The document is divided in sections, seperated by blank pages. – <strong>P2</strong></li>
<li>The current ideas/prototypes are in the first section. All discarded or ›paused‹ ones are in later sections (the archive”) – <strong>P2</strong> […]</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>You just add the participant code at the end or beginning of each line. It is not the most exiting work but it can be done quickly – Copy the current coder in the computer's clipboard (STRG+C), place the cursor with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_keys">arrow keys</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_key">end</a>/ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_key">home</a> keys and paste the code (STRG+V).</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="annotate"><a href="#annotate">Annotate</a></h2>
<p>After you added your participant codes you can start to review and to annotate your data in order to find possible interpretations, themes and meaning behind the observations and utterances.</p>
<p>This will help you to get familiar with the data and to derive meaningful themes and insights later.</p>
<p>Annotations are possible interpretations and questions tied to a line in your transcript. It can be full sentences as well as short list of words.</p>
<div class="example">
<ul>
<li>It is hard to know what exactly the client wants, because I don’t talk directly to the client – P2 <strong>ANNOTATION: indirectness, division of tasks, friction, „I need to know the client“.</strong></li>
<li>The document is divided in sections, separated by blank pages. – P2 <strong>ANNOTATION: Keeping/imposing order</strong></li>
<li>The current ideas/prototypes are in the first section. All discarded or “paused” ones are in later sections (the archive”) – P2 <strong>ANNOTATION: Keeps old ideas. Why? Possible: Later reuse, Inspiration, replication</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I suggest to annotate each line, but this is not a must.</p>
<p>The annotations should be clearly distinguishable from data you got directly from observation or the participant’s answers – just like other things you did add yourself (e.g. design ideas).</p>
<p>I would recommend using a word processor with a comment function. Open your transcript, mark the part you want to annotate with your interpretation, then click the »comment« button. If you don't use a word processor, but plaintext, use something like »COMMENT:« or »ANNOTATION:« to mark your comments; If you prefer to do your annotations with a pen and a highlighter, print your notes with double line-spacing to have enough room for writing.</p>
<p>Annotating your data is a creative process. If in doubt whether an annotation is relevant or not: opt for writing it. Later on it might become useful. If you are unsure about something or an idea seems to be far fetched, just go for it. Since you keep data and comments distinguishable from each other you can always throw stuff out again. The goal is not to come up with great annotations but to wrap your head around the data and to find possible ways to interpreting it.</p>
<h2 id="digital-or-analog-analyis"><a href="#digital-or-analog-analyis">Digital or analog analyis?</a></h2>
<p>If you analyze your data using paper notes, your titles will be written on a sticky note of a specific color (choose one, but stick with it). If you use a word processor, use a headline for the groups titles.</p>
<p>After annotating your data you should take the decision in which media you want to conduct your analysis: Digital in a word processor, where lines hold the basic units of data, or analog on paper, where sticky notes are your means of dealing with the data.</p>
<p>The analysis methods described here can be used in both media. Nevertheless, each way has different strengths.</p>

<p>The resources you need for analysing on your computer are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a word processor</li>
</ul>
<p>The resources you need for with pen and paper are:</p>
<ul>
<li>sticky notes</li>
<li>paper</li>
<li>printer (or a lot of patience to write all by hand)</li>
<li>(removable) tape</li>
<li>a big wall (2m*3m minimum – which is why the wall is usually the showstopper ).</li>
</ul>
<p>But why should you want to use an analog analysis if it needs all these resources? Partly, the decision can be based on preferences: Some people like that they can move around the notes by hand and can get an overview of their data by just stepping back and glancing over it.</p>
<p>If you work with peers on your analysis you have some advantages when using the analogue pen and paper approach: you can easily discuss your ideas with other and will get new ideas how to structure the data. You could as well invite your boss to take a look and be part of the team, at least for some time. This type of on-site, collaborative, analysis is best done analogue. It is easy to move notes around, and you can refer by pointing to data or just carry it over to someone and ask for an interpretation. Using digital tools it is not that easy and direct– despite of all the great digital tools we have nowadays.</p>
<h3 id="how-to"><a href="#how-to">How-To</a></h3>
<h4 id="analysis-on-the-computer"><a href="#analysis-on-the-computer">Analysis on the computer</a></h4>
<p>For analysis on your computer I suggest the following steps for preparing your analysis:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a new document</li>
<li>Paste your transcript into that document</li>
<li>Add a page break before the transcript to separate not-yet-grouped data from your (upcoming) structure of lines grouped by themes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Creating Groups:</strong> Similar data is organized in lists. To rearrange data you can use copy paste, drag and drop and the tools the word processor provides (toolbar to move points in lists etc.)<br /> <strong>Group Titles/Themes</strong>: Each group gets a headline. Create a hierarchy by using different paragraph styles – bigger headlines encompass smaller, lower in hierarchy headlines. If you use paragraph styles to format your headlines, you ca n use the navigation tool of the wordprocessor to go through your structure</p>
<h4 id="analysis-with-pen-and-paper"><a href="#analysis-with-pen-and-paper">Analysis with pen and paper</a></h4>
<p>For working analog I recommend the following steps to get analysis-ready:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create table in a word processor, many rows, 2 columns (given you print on DINA4) . Each table cell will be a note.
<ol type="1">
<li>In the table settings, switch off page breaks in cells and switch »keep paragraphs together« on, so that one note/table cell will not break between pages.</li>
<li>In the table settings, choose a decent padding around each cell, like 0.5cm</li>
<li>Choose a font size of about 12pt, large enough to read it<br /><img src="images/createAnalogNotes.png" /></li>
</ol></li>
<li>copy/paste all your data (line by line) from the transcript into the cells</li>
<li>print it</li>
<li>cut out each table cell (=piece of data)</li>
<li>cover the wall with the paper from paper rolls (thus you can remove the analysis, roll up the paper and archive it and you could remove it from the wall temporarily)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Creating groups</strong>: during analysis you will stick your printed notes on the widths of paper using removable tape, crepe tape or spray glue – something sticky but non-permanent, so you can move the notes around in order to gradually improve the structure.<br /> <strong>Group titles/Themes</strong>: Write your group titles on notes of determined colors, which are different from the color of the actual data points. If you print your data points on white paper you could use yellow sticky notes for group titles and pink ones for titles of a group of groups.</p>
<h2 id="firstStructure"><a href="#firstStructure">Develop a first Structure</a></h2>
<p>After you annotated your data you can start to structure the it. Structuring the data means suggesting themes behind the data, naming these themes and decide which data falls under which theme.</p>
<p>You don't use all your data yet. Start with what you find useful when skimming through it or use just the data of two participants for now. The goal is to set up some preliminary structure, like a scaffold.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/lego_housefirstStructure.jpg" alt="setting up a basic structure" /><figcaption>setting up a basic structure</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="move-in-approximation"><a href="#move-in-approximation">Move in Approximation</a></h3>
<p>The easiest way to start a structure is moving similar data in approximation. If you do you analysis on paper, cluster notes you assume to follow a common theme in one place and notes for other themes in other places. If you analyze using a wordprocessor, move similar notes in adjacent lines. Create different groups, each containing similar notes, by using several line breaks above and below such a group or by creating a list for each assumed theme.</p>
<div class="example">
<ul>
<li>Asking herself: what would impress the person (a safety advisor) »probably not that the blueprint is beautiful«</li>
<li>Good: Something that is not only useful, but aesthetically as well</li>
</ul>
<p><em>These themes have in common that they are about aesthetics and requirements. I did not have a good idea about a possible group title or even an insight I can draw from them, so I just moved them in approximation.</em></p>

</div>
<h3 id="name-commonalities"><a href="#name-commonalities">Name Commonalities</a></h3>
<p>You may have some data you assume to encompass a common theme but you don't know if you can state an insight about the data. But you have a vague feeling that it may be connected to something. In this case just give that group of data a preliminary title. A group name, even if it is not an insight, will make dealing with the data easier since it gives your data some structure.</p>
<p>As you gather other data that falls under that (yet vague) category you may be able to formulate and insight you gain about the underlying data.</p>
<div class="example">
<ul>
<li>Inspiration
<ul>
<li>I try to get new ideas by looking at google images</li>
<li>While showering I get new ideas</li>
<li>[…]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Media
<ul>
<li>I like to use photos</li>
<li>The website is a great way to reach out</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>These are mere titles, naming a commonality of the underlying data but telling nothing useful for design (yet)</em></p>
</div>
<h3 id="state-insights"><a href="#state-insights">State insights</a></h3>
<p>You may have read through your annotations and have noticed something that may make a good insight right away. Great. Just write it down and assign the data to it. Even if you have only one or two pieces of data that fit the insight, don't worry, just see if the insight will emerge to be bigger. If not, you can still revise the insight or just get rid of it and see where else the data might fit.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>My first found insights were these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review previous projects</li>
<li>Test designs in the media you deliver in</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /> The structure of my analysis looked like that (the main list points are titles of groups-of-groups, the indented sub-lists are group titles):</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspiration
<ul>
<li>Review previous projects</li>
<li>Other (Web, Bookstore)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Media
<ul>
<li>Do tests in the media you target</li>
<li>Suitablility of media</li>
<li>»being closer« : 2 page spreads instead of single pages etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Idea Attachment</li>
<li>Motivation at the beginning; then the problems start.</li>
<li>Finishing is good</li>
<li>(Page) Format is hard to change later</li>
<li>TrialAndError</li>
<li>Mutual dependencies of design elements like type area, content, font size etc. (?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that some of the themes are actual, meaningful insights (»Finishing is good«, »(Page) Format is hard to change later«), while some are mere group titles based on commonalities of the data they encompass (»Inspiration«, »Trial and Error«).</p>
</div>
<p>Now you will have some preliminary, data based themes, each created based on a few data points. Now we will see if these themes are useful for organizing more than just a few data points.</p>
<h2 id="fill-the-structure"><a href="#fill-the-structure">Fill the Structure</a></h2>
<p>When you came up with some themes to structure your data you need to see if the structure is feasible. Go through your data and sort it into the themes – be it actual insights or just stated commonalities –<br />you came up with, or just move the data into proximity to similar data.</p>
<p>The difference to the previous step is that we now focus on involving all the data into the process of generating themes. In contrast, in the previous steps we focused more on generating a structure.</p>
<p>If the previous step was building a (data-based) scaffold, now we try to build the actual walls.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/lego_houseWalls.jpg" alt="Build upon your preliminary structure to see if the idea actually works" /><figcaption>Build upon your preliminary structure to see if the idea actually works</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Aim for 3 to 10 pieces of data per theme. While it is temporarily o.k. to have very small groups, at the end each theme should be derived from several data points and not on a single utterance. On the other hand if a theme encompasses more than 10 utterances or observations, think if creating two aspects or »subthemes« would make sense.</p>
<p>Usually I would go chronologically through all my notes starting with the first participant and ending with the most recent one – though any other scheme will suffice as well. Just be sure that you know with which data you dealt with already and with which you did not.</p>
<p>When filling the data in the structure you may notice that you need to create additional themes; some may need to be renamed as well. Just go ahead and make these changes if you feel they are needed.</p>
<div class="example">
<ul>
<li>[Title:] Test in the media you target
<ul>
<li>I folded prototypes for paper sizes that seem to be suitable</li>
<li>This is close the print shops results without spending too much</li>
<li>Tedious: Not having an own printer</li>
<li>[…]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>[Title]»being closer«: Page Spreads instead of single pages
<ul>
<li>Creates page spreads (In books you have always 2 opposite pages, thus single pages are not useful for design)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br /> Actually the example above is is not great in terms of analysis: The »Test in the Media you target« data is almost all from one person (P3) and the »being closer«-Group has only a single data point. In later iterations I'll change this group. But for now it suffices.</p>
<p><br /><br /> While I was sorting the data I created a new group to accommodate data related to changes in designs:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Titel:]Changing and determining
<ul>
<li>Determining: What do we have? What do we need? What do we want to avoid?</li>
<li>Sketching, e.g. for »How can I divide the page for 7 days of the week?«</li>
<li>»This is trial and error«</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /> Some data could not be accommodated yet. So I created a misc group, where I could offload the data for now and try to find a better place later:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Titel:]misc
<ul>
<li>god: Shortcuts</li>
<li>I need to ask the print shop what this design would cost</li>
<li>bad: Doing the same steps over and over again.</li>
<li>[…many other points…]</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Inside the misc group some possibilities for future insights emerged – for example the first (god: Shortcuts) and the third point (»bad: doing the…« could be part of a newly formed insights named »I want to avoid repetitive tasks«</p>
</div>
<p>Now your groups will be informed by several data points each. But there will be many themes that are created by the »same things mentioned«-Method; they don’t state insights. In addition there might be overlapping themes and groups encompassing many data while other groups may be only informed by few data points from just one participant. It is time to revise the structure.</p>
<h2 id="revise-the-structure"><a href="#revise-the-structure">Revise the Structure</a></h2>
<p>After you went through your data and sorted it into themes and tried to formulate insights, review your work. You now may have a clearer view of what constitutes the themes after you matched the data with them.</p>
<p>If you recently dealt with just a particular part of the analysis (like dealing with two particular groups), your view might be too narrow: Glance over the whole range of clustered data, themes and insights and rediscover themes which might be a better fit for some data.</p>
<p>Have a look at structures that need improvement: Groups that have a theme but don't express an actual insight yet as well as data for which you did not find a good place. This data might be helpful to create insights.</p>
<p>Take a critical look at insights in relation to the data they encompass: Is there a fit or did you fall prey to wishful thinking? Possibly there is actually only a weak match between the stated insight and the data. In this case revise your structure.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/lego_houseRevise.jpg" alt="Some parts need to be revised and newly created" /><figcaption>Some parts need to be revised and newly created</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="find-better-names"><a href="#find-better-names">Find better names</a></h3>
<p>Groups based on commonalities or vague similarity will hopefully evolve into insights. To archive this, try to revise group titles: make them more concise, clear and meaningful. Try to state an actual insights for a group if a group of data is just named with a title based on mere commonalities of the data in that group. This will almost certainly require moving some data between groups as well in order to accommodate the data to the improved structure.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>For one group I used the title »Arranging«, since arranging and aligning objects, lines and text to a predefined grid or to each other was a task that reoccured frequently. But the title »Arranging« just names a commonality. To make clear that the group is about a user activity and to state the theme as an insight, I renamed »Arranging« to »Arranging objects is an important activity«</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>I had a group titled »repetitive and manually«. This could be easily stated as an insight: »repetitive and ›do-it-manually‹ tasks are tedious«. By just adding the users view (»are tedious«) the title became an insight which is a useful principle for design.</p>
</div>
<br /><br />
<div class="example">
<p>I had the following structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspiration
<ul>
<li>Review previous projects</li>
<li>Others (Web, Bookshop)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>»Inspiration« is a title based on the »same-things-mentioned«-principle so I had a look at the underlying data. They all were about inspiration – but they had another commonality: All inspiration techniques used other, existing designs, often ones that were created by the same person or even for the same project (It would have been possible that people take a walk or have frequent brainstormings or take drugs to get new ideas etc.). The insight I came up with was: »I use existing designs for inspiration«</p>
</div>
<h3 id="re-move-data-to-other-groups"><a href="#re-move-data-to-other-groups">(re) move data to other groups</a></h3>
<p>When improving your structure it might be necessary to remove pieces of data from groups, either moving to to a temporary »misc« group or to another, more suitable group.</p>
<p>While we want to make use of the data we have, it is most important to create sound and helpful principles based on the data – instead of just putting everything under a label.</p>
<p>It is possible that you can state an insight more clearly but as a result, the clearer title may no longer encompass all data in the group. In this case, go for clarity of the groups title, even if it means that the theme does not encompass all the data currently subsumed in the group.</p>
<p>Take out the data that does not fit the improved title and see if it might fit better to another group. If not, place it in a »not yet grouped« or »misc«-Group. Revise that »misc« group when you made changes to your system and see if you can use the data from that group to enhance other groups with that data.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>I reviewed the following group:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feedback
<ul>
<li>good: getting feedback</li>
<li>bad: uncertainty before feedback from client</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><br />The title was not a meaningful insight and I felt that the analysis might benefit if I use the data in other themes. I already had a cluster related to motivations and emotions– where I moved <em>»bad: uncertainty before feedback from client«</em>. The <em>»good: getting feedback«</em> was moved to a cluster named <em>»Exchange with others«</em>.</p>
While I think I gained something out of it, these changes did not result in a new much better structure but was part of trials and errors in the process.
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Going through the data of a group named »general requirements« I noted that a big part of the data was concerned with balancing<br /><em>functional</em> or <em>practical</em> requirements (price, readability etc.) with requirements concerning <em>style</em> (using colors, being innovative)</p>
<p>Thus I renamed the group to »trying to combine aesthetics and functionality«. As the new title was more specific some data needed to be taken out, put into other groups or to the temporary »misc« group.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The previous examples were concerned with whole themes and thus focused on the macro level. Sometimes you just move data itself, without any trigger like renaming, just because you found a better fit. For example <em>»using the maximum possible height on a sheet of paper«</em> was grouped into »media«. Later, I moved it to <em>»budget«</em> because budget is something the user is directly concerned with, whereas media is even more abstract. The group <em>»budget«</em> was then later renamed <em>»having little money and resources«</em>, expressing that a part of the participants work was finding out how they could make the most out of a small budget (<em>»using the maximum possible height on a sheet of paper«</em> is a practice that results from that concern.)</p>
</div>
<h3 id="create-subgroups"><a href="#create-subgroups">Create Subgroups</a></h3>
<p>Some groups may grow rather big, especially if their themes are not insights but are based on mere commonalities of underlying data (like »dealing with color«). This is an excellent opportunity to develop themes by creating subgroups. The process of developing subgroups is like in <a href="#firstStructure">»Develop a first structure«</a> (just inside the group): Move similar data in proximity and try to create clear-cut insights if possible. In this process you might find a more suitable way to state the theme of the main group as well.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>I had a group with more than ten points regarding »Collegues and Friends«. This title was rather general and thus not very useful for design. I created two subgroups which were more meaningful.</p>
<p><br />Before:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collegues, Friends etc.
<ul>
<li>A friend told her that concrete is visualized dashed</li>
<li>Puts sketches on the wall: Others will see it and talk with me.</li>
<li>Which design do we take? Talks with fellow designer</li>
<li>[…]</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>after splitting and rearrangement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exchange Knowledge
<ul>
<li>A friend told her that concrete is visualized dashed</li>
<li>Puts sketches on the wall: Others will see it and talk with me.</li>
<li>[…]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>making decisions with others
<ul>
<li>Which design do we take? Talks with fellow designer</li>
<li>feedback-rounds with other designers</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>One main point in my first structure was »Highly motivated at the beginning; then the problems start.«. After restructuring this became a sub point of motivation related groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>[group-of-groups] Motivations
<ul>
<li>[Subgroup]: Highly motivated at the beginning; then the problems start.</li>
<li>[Subgroup]: Finishing is good</li>
<li>[Subgroup]: Waiting for feedback is bad</li>
<li>[Subgroup]: being afraid of clients rejection of the design</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p><br /> sometimes you first sort the data under the overarching title or principle and than move it to an already existing subgroup later:</p>
<p>The utterance: »Its bad that you can do imprecise things here, compared to programming (talking about Illustrator)« was first sorted into »Media« and subsequently put into »using the right media«</p>
</div>

</figure>
<p>The steps above do build on each other. But like in other creative tasks there will be a lot of going back and forth between steps of creating groups, assigning data to them and revising these groups.</p>
<p>These iterations may also happen in parts of the structure you create. For example, after you revised your overall structure, you find that a grouping should undergo a major change and you put all its data out. Then you are back to developing a structure for a part of your analysis. Or you notice that some notes that you moved in proximity can be summarized by a clear principle, and you jump straight to the revision of that part of the analysis, leaving the »fill in the data« step out.</p>
<p>This process can take up some time. The analysis may never come to an actual halt, but it will slow down at some point. Continuing to move data may still do minor improvements but there are no big changes anymore. Review the data a last time. The analysis is finished and it is time to communicate your results.</p>

<p>  These are all the groups I created in my analysis. The results could be more concise, having fewer groups concentrating on fewer themes. However this would probably lead to more abstract insights which would presumably harder to use in design.</p>
<p>The groups of groups are partly not insights themselves. I tried to find some, but was not able in a part of the cases: »changes and requirements« is not an insight (but it’s subordinated groups are: »combining functions and aesthetics« etc.). In contrast, »using existing works for inspiration« is a group of groups which states a meaningful insight.</p>
<p>You see that I could not use all data, so I made some less significant groups in the “misc” section.</p>

<h1 id="communicate-results"><a href="#communicate-results">Communicate Results</a></h1>
<p>If you work with others, the results of your research need to be communicated.</p>
<p>Aside from getting the results of your research across, communicating your results has some positive side effects: collecting, organizing and summarizing your findings will make it easier for yourself to remember your findings and you may be even able to improve your analysis further.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the »right« way of communicating research results is highly dependent on several factors: The skills and knowledge of the audience, the goals of the project in general (the research in particular) and the kind of reports your audience is used to.</p>
<p>So what I describe here can only be seen as a general introduction: I try not to focus on particular forms of deliverables but show you the elements you can combine in different media to communicate your results.</p>
<h2 id="getting-it-across"><a href="#getting-it-across">Getting it across</a></h2>
<p>It can be hard to make an impact with your research: If it is not clear why the results of your research matter they are easily dismissed</p>
<p>Probably the best form to communicate your research is to do the research (at least partly) with others. Those who do the research with you will know first-hand how it was done and what the results were. In addition, they will probably identify themselves with the research and its outcomes and might support your cause.</p>
<p>However, this is not always possible and you may need to resort to a less interactive, more typical form of communication – like writing reports and making presentations. When you communicate your results in this way, keep in mind that reports and slides may easily end up as »dead documents« – informations which are available but are not used.</p>
<p>To make this less likely to happen, find out what the interests of the document’s audience are and how you can communicate with them to get their attention.  </p>
<h2 id="who-is-your-audience"><a href="#who-is-your-audience">Who is your audience?</a></h2>
<p>Consider the audience’s needs when communicating. If you want a programmer to understand you, you might highlight different aspects and use different words compared to presenting the results to your professor or boss. Think about what matters for those who should listen to you and structure your information accordingly: If your professor cares about novel ways of interaction, highlight aspects that might help when developing them; if some people you work with think that »users don’t get it«, emphasize the reasons for the behavior of the people you studied.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the jargon that might be used by others has its own rules. Only use words and concepts that will be understood by your audience and which you know yourself – don’t fake it.</p>
<h2 id="explain-your-research"><a href="#explain-your-research">Explain your Research</a></h2>
<p>You should not only communicate your results but as well how you got to them. This permits others to evaluate your research in the context of the explained methods and enables you to show that you arrived at your results using an empirical and structured approach.</p>
<h3 id="describe-your-methods"><a href="#describe-your-methods">Describe your Methods</a></h3>
<p>Explain the research methods you used to arrive at your results. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selection of participants (sampling) </li>
<li>Data gathering </li>
<li>Data analyis </li>
</ul>
<div class="example">
<p>I recruited the participants by asking on mailing lists, bulletin boards and in facebook groups. The request was like this:</p>
<p>“We, a team of students of the Weimar University, want to improve the free layout program frame drawer and want the application to match your workflow and needs. Therefore we would like to gather some insights in the way you work.</p>
<p>If you would like to support us, someone from our team would visit your workplace and ask you some questions and look over your shoulder while you work. This would take approximately 1h.</p>
<p>All participants get a $10 voucher for the university's cafeteria. If you would like to participate (or have further questions) please write a mail to jan.dittrich@example.com”</p>
<p>(Data gathering)</p>
<p>We gathered the data by asking open questions in a semi-structured interviews. In addition, we observed the research participants doing their work. The participants were invited to just continue to work on what they would have done when we would not have been there.</p>
<p>The data gathering was done by single researchers, though one session was done by two team members together (one taking notes, the other asking the questions)</p>
<p>We recorded the data by doing an audio recording of questions and answers in addition to handwritten notes. We photographed and sketched participants during key activities and made photos and sketches of tools important to their work.</p>
<p>(Analysis)</p>
<p>After the research sessions we gathered all notes and supplemented forgotten or unclear data by using the audio recordings and sketches. We annotated all data for possible meanings and interrelations to create a preliminary scheme for organizing the data into meaningful principles. This patterns served as a starting point for organizing and reordering the data during several iterations. Thus, the process was similar to affinity diagramming (Beyer, Holtzblatt) or Thematic Analysis (Virginia, Clarke)</p>
</div>
<h3 id="describe-site-and-sample"><a href="#describe-site-and-sample">Describe site and sample</a></h3>
<p>To make your research less abstract for the audience, give an introduction to the environment you did the research in. Describe it in a way that allows others to imagine it, for example by showing sketches, photos of tools or the participant’s workplace. Remember to show only what the participants agreed to share with you and the audience.</p>
<p>In addition to the context, describe your research participants by giving a general user profile. Thus you don’t share any personal data of anyone but allow your audience to have some ideas of the participants.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Participants were students (four of them) or recent graduates (one of them).  All had studied several terms already and had work experiences from at least one internship. Four were female, one were male.</p>
<p>All participants were asked to meet with us at the place where they usually work. Partly this was in their flats; We met one participant in a shared working space and one remotely via telephone and screensharing.</p>

<h2 id="components-of-deliverables-and-reports"><a href="#components-of-deliverables-and-reports">Components of deliverables and reports</a></h2>
<p>Let me give a brief overview of typical building blocks for communicating your research. They are all useful on their own and you can combine them to use their strengths together.</p>
<h3 id="text"><a href="#text">Text</a></h3>
<p>Text is as very versatile way to convey informations. On the downside, text may seem not as quickly accessible as a diagram or a sketch. To lower the barriers, make sure that people know why they are reading your text. Give essential information at the beginning (What is this text about? Why was the work done?) and make sure that it is easy to get a quick overview: Structure your text using headings, lists and italics to guide the reader.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/exampleWrittenReport.png" alt="a page spead from a report" /><figcaption>a page spead from a report</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are lots of books which explain how to write concise and easy-to-get text. The most efficient guide I know was given by George Orwells in »Politics and the English Language« – I quote:</p>
<blockquote>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.</p></li>
<li><p>Never use a long word where a short one will do.</p></li>
<li><p>If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.</p></li>
<li><p>Never use the passive where you can use the active.  </p></li>
<li><p>Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.  </p></li>
<li><p>Break any of these rules sooner than say anything barbarous.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In addition, read the text aloud – in particular, if you already noticed that you have had difficulties finding the right word or to express a complicated concept. If you need to re-read sentences to make sense of them or to stress the right words, you should go for a rewrite.</p>
<h3 id="quotes"><a href="#quotes">Quotes</a></h3>
<p>Quotes convey the participant’s motivations and feelings. This is important to help others to have empathy with the users.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><strong>Rather abstract:</strong> Users like the alignment function</p>
<strong>Combined with Quote</strong>: Users like the alignment function. Sandy: »It is like doing work by magic – click! And its there!«
</div>
<p>Remember to protect the participant's identity if they did not give you the permission to share their quotes or names. If they did not give you the permission, only share a plausible, but faked »quote« and don't use real names but faked ones as well. Don’t deceive your audience either: mention that the names and quotes are not real but are only corresponding to their actual counterparts.</p>
<h3 id="scenarios"><a href="#scenarios">Scenarios</a></h3>
<p>Activities don’t happen in isolation from each other: They depend on previous activities and (possible changing) motivations. One way to communicate a sequence of interrelated activities is a scenario. Simply put, a scenario is a short story written as text or given as a sequence of images (like a comic)</p>
<p>A good framework for writing scenarios is asking yourself these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Person</strong>: Who is the main person in the scenario? </li>
<li><strong>Motivations</strong>: Why does this person what he/she does? What is the motivation? </li>
<li><strong>Activities</strong>: What are the actions of the person and how are they done?  </li>
<li> <strong>Context</strong>: Where and When does the scenario take place?  </li>
</ul>
<p>Answer them in your scenario.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Annika studies media culture and needs to finish here homework on »Cultural subconceptualist theory in the works of Koons« in order to hand the homework in on time. She goes to the library to see if the book on »Capitalism in the works of Rushdie« by Andreas Geoffrey contains arguments supporting her view on the structuralist paradigm.</p>
<p>She enters the library and walks up to one of the computers standing in the corners of the library's halls.</p>
<p>She wants to look up the name of the author, but she notes that she forgot the copy of the book that referenced the work. She still knows that »Rusdie« or »Rushdie« was in the title of the book she needs. After several trials she finds the right spelling of the name and, after scanning through a list, she finds the book she wants to read. The detail page of the search application gives the address of the library building she is in already and a code: »X0-3R52«… [scenario may continue]</p>

</figure>
</div>
<h3 id="diagrams"><a href="#diagrams">Diagrams</a></h3>
<p>Diagrams are useful to show high-level concepts, relations and dependencies – for example showing which activities need to be done to create a page of a magazine or the ways a group of students share files when working together on a joint project.</p>

</figure>
<h3 id="photos-and-illustrations"><a href="#photos-and-illustrations">Photos and Illustrations</a></h3>
<p>Which one is easier to understand and less ambiguous:</p>
<p>This:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The participant’s desk is rather tidy. In front of the keyboard is a book and on the book a calculator. Left hand are additional utilities, like…</p>
</div>
<p>Or that:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/ObservationDesignU4Workplace.jpg" />
</figure>
<p>I suppose the image wins.</p>
<p>While the above example just shows a setting, we could as well combine the strengths of text and images in an annotated photo.</p>
<p>Or you could show your general findings about how people organize their desktops by sketching a prototypical arrangement of items.</p>
<p>Illustrations and photos in particular have another function aside of getting information across: They make the research and its findings more graspable, intuitive and »real« for your audience. Just like scenarios and quotes they enable to imagine how your research participants acted which in turn helps to develop empathy for them. Consider again our example from above in which an image and a text were compared. The photo does not only give some abstract information. It shows that you have been with actual participant or – in this case – did research on actual tools they use.</p>
<p>When using photos, remember to protect the privacy of your participants. Only show photos of their workplaces or of themselves if they agreed to it.</p>
<h2 id="typical-documents-for-reporting-results-deliverables"><a href="#typical-documents-for-reporting-results-deliverables">Typical Documents for reporting results (»Deliverables«)</a></h2>
<p>You can combine text, images diagrams and scenarios in several ways to communicate your message. Let’s look at some possibilities.</p>
<h3 id="quick-findings"><a href="#quick-findings">Quick findings</a></h3>
<p>Quick findings are short, annotated lists of your most important findings. They include a brief description of methods, participants and environment and usually a disclaimer that this is only a very brief summary and that the  (preliminary) results may be refined later.</p>
<p>Quick findings are very useful if your audience :</p>
<ul>
<li>already know about your research and want to have a look at your progress</li>
<li> have very little time, and need an efficient access to your results</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="written-reports"><a href="#written-reports">Written Reports</a></h3>
<p>Written reports are roughly four to a several dozen pages long. Nevertheless, only deliver what the audience needs and wants to know – be concise. It is easy to get sidetracked and to write length and complex sentences.</p>
<p>Written reports consist mainly of text, but you should use images, quotes and diagrams too when they make sense.</p>
<p>I suggest the following structure for your reports:</p>
<ul>
<li>summary of the key facts and findings</li>
<li>Why: Research interest</li>
<li>How: Research methods</li>
<li>Who and Where: Describe participants and site </li>
<li>Your findings </li>
<li>Conclusions and suggestions </li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="images/exampleWrittenReport2.png" alt="page spread from a report on wiki use for teaching at university" /><figcaption>page spread from a report on wiki use for teaching at university</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="slides"><a href="#slides">Slides</a></h3>
<p>Slides can deliver the same content as written reports or quick findings. They convey the information in a more visual way – so they have fewer text and more images, diagrams, and storyboards.</p>
<p>If you give the presentation yourself try to deliver as few as possible of the information by text on the slides. You can do the talking and the slides supplement the information you give. On the other side, it may makes sense to use more text on the slides if you just share the slides with others and don’t present them yourself.</p>
